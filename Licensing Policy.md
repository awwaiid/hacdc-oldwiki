This policy, as written here:
<http://wiki.hacdcserver.org/index.php?title=Licensing_Policy>, was
approved during the [Regular Member Meeting 2013 06
11](Regular_Member_Meeting_2013_06_11).

Point four of our [Mission Statement](Mission_Statement) says
HacDC will [ freely share its research and discoveries, using what is
learned to teach
others](Mission_Statement#Freely_share_its_research_and_discoveries,_using_what_is_learned_to_teach_others).

In general, our licensing policy guarantees this mission point as well
as ensuring that HacDC remains compliant with the spirit and letter of
the law for [
501(c)(3)](wikipedia:501%28c%29#501.28c.29.283.29) exempt
non-profit organizations.

Our licensing policy is considered a part of our general promotion of
collaboration.
