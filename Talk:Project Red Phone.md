## Freeworlddialup connection is online {#freeworlddialup_connection_is_online}

I donated a
[HT-488](http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Grandstream+Handytone-488)
SIP ATA to the space and wired it up to the pay phone. It uses
[FreeWorldDialup](http://www.freeworlddialup.com/) for SIP connectivity
(account 934122, phone 393-123-4567) with
[IPKall](http://www.ipkall.com/) for inbound POTS calls (phone
253-243-2280). The accounts, passwords and details are written on a
sticker on the bottom of the ATA and as of this evening it was
functional. -- [Hudson](User:Hudson) 04:52, 9 December 2008
