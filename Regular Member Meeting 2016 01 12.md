## Approval of Previous Meeting's Minutes

## Recognition

-   Dan, Julia, et al. - Commissioning OpticalTableRobot as a working
    large-scale high-precision laser cutter under difficult conitions
-   Ethan Waldo - Extensive installing, testing, and configuring WebRTC
    as well as our PFSense firewall to bring first-class web
    conferencing capabilities to HacDC.

#### Basement Policy

Would appreciate seeing HacDC willing to trust and back its volunteers
after a success like the OpticalTableRobot. If additional safety or
convenience features were wanted, encouring feature requests might have
been nice to hear. Instead, the response included 'not cool' from some
of the more sane, senior members of the community.

Honestly, the extent of such negativity at HacDC has exceeded my worst
imagination, crushing hopes for the future. If not now, when will HacDC
ever take appropriate steps to limit damage that can be done by people
who don't know and don't care? This is why we can't have nice things.

Really, the key problem is that the shop areas have been a free-for-all.
Too little decision-making or policing authority is given to those who
have actually built them up. Consequently, too much is wasted arguing
over how shop areas should be repurposed, trying to satisfy competing
interests, or repairing damage caused by reckless endangerment. As a
specific example, access to the shop areas should involve some kind of
vetting procedure that alerts us to persons with special needs, and
addresses severe problems quickly.

Some solutions to safety, prioritization, and access control problems in
the basement include:

-   Lock the basement permanently, appoint Dan, a self-selecting
    committee, or the BoD, in charge of who has access or gets kicked
    out.
-   Transfer ownership of the basement and at least some tools to a new
    organization focused on representing a more specific mission.
-   State some shop rules, or appoint tool custodians, add a waiver to
    membership induction, ban members for violation and/or unwillingness
    to take responsibility.

All of these options have cavets, and/or require effective leadership,
though not necessarily a new standing rule or bylaws ammendment. Seeing
the membership unanamiously support solving the problem is more
important than the specifics of any particular policy. Please dedicate
some time toward considering this now, and especially at the annual
meeting. Further, please consider running for a BoD position.

Again, this matters, and represents a crucial milestone at HacDC.
**Please dedicate some time and thought to our future.**

With effective leadership and sound policies, we could have a good year,
back on track as a real hackerspace.

#### OpticalTableRobot Repairs

Since the laser tube was found to be damaged or defective, fully
re-commissioning our new OpticalTableRobot laser will involve:

1.  Fix the policy around the basement so volunteers can work with less
    politics.
2.  Replace the tube. Maybe try a cheap, expendable tube for the first
    few hundred hours.
3.  Stiffen the joints between axes. Not essential, but nice.
4.  Add OctoPi or similar web interface, for usability.
5.  Add walls for safety, to keep the collimated beam on the table.
6.  Add an acrylic lid, again for safety.

If the FullSpectrum's appearance and software stack really is crucially
important, then we could literally adapt its control electronics to
drive the OpticalTableRobot's systems. Bottom line, we can achive much
better performance, usability, an especially durability.

With regard to budget decisions, it is important to consider that we
have not only lost a \$1k laser tube, but also about the same value in
linear motion equipment. Both the long-life tube and extra linear motion
equipment are technically non-essential, but would contribute greatly to
durability. Keep in perspective that the laser tube is not the only
casualty or near-casualty related to either of our laser cutting
systems. Moreover, irreplaceable volunteer hours have gone into both. On
that note, our custom exhaust system for the FullSpectrum machine was
nearly trashed.

#### Commercial Laser Cutters

Off-the-shelf laser cutters are of throw-away quality with miniscule
build area and lackluster precision. However, they have also become
cheaply available from eBay. If someone not alreay working on the
OpticalTableRobot is up to the task, we could allocate up to \$500 for a
\~\$350 machine.

-   Income earmarked for HARC: \$675

### Secretary's Report

-   We gained a new member last month but we lost three members also.
-   We're at 38 members, therefore quoum is 10, majority is 20 and
    3/4ths is 29.

### Director-at-Large Reports

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports

### Project SUPPLIES

Nothing to report.

### Project EXPANSION

\$37.89, More screws for basement printer.

### Project HAMRADIO

## Member Reports

-   Enrique: I brought in a brand new ladder for the basement; it was
    about \$94 and I'd like to be reimbursed either by Expansion or by
    member vote from the general fund. The sharpies are a donation. The
    first of the Introduction to Linux events had pretty low turnout.
    The next one is Friday. I'm also facilitating a Kerbal Space Program
    meetup next week. CryptoParty discussions are starting up again but
    we don't have a fixed date yet.

-   mirage335: Finally clearing my schedule. TazMega actually working.
    On the other hand, time will tell if bringing similar tools or
    anything else to HacDC is worthwhile. Also, would like to take
    possession of some linear motion in the basement that has already
    been mistreted, for future attempts to duplicate the OTR's success
    elsewhere.

## Old Business

## New Business

-   EdTechDMV, a non-profit that hosts educational tech events for DC
    teachers and developers in the education software market, wants to
    hold classes at HacDC during business hours later this year. This is
    a problem that's come up before: How to grant access to the
    classroom to other organizations when a member can't be around to
    open/lock up. For example, we could make someone from that
    organization (Bill or Matt Z) a member and waive their dues, but
    that wouldn't be a "hardship" waiver exactly, and they would count
    towards quorum and not really be an involved member of HacDC... so
    another arrangement would be good, preferably more official than
    just handing them a key. - Enrique
-   Approve some kind of enforceable policy for limiting longstanding
    competition for and reckless behavior in basement areas. Or, at
    least pass a non-binding resolution to do so, as a show of support
    for our volunteers.
-   Approve \$2k for fully re-commissioning the OpticalTableRobot.
-   Approve \$500 for an off-the-shelf throw-away eBay laser cutter.
