HacDC is hosting a biweekly study group dedicated to mastering the
fabled computer science text, [Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), by Harold Abelson and Gerald
Jay Sussman, with Julie Sussman. This text is now available for free
under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). We began in
May, 2012 and plan to continue this session until we finish the book.

## Logistics

Anyone is welcome to attend, normally the meetings are held in person at
the [HacDC space](http://www.hacdc.org/location/), in the classroom
area, although if that is booked, we may meet in the sanctuary.

### Meetup Group

We keep the master calendar on [the HacDC
meetup](http://www.meetup.com/hac-dc/events/calendar/) calendar. Please
RSVP If you plan to attend a session.

### Mailing List

Students are encouraged to join the [SICP mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/hacdc.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sicp)
where class discussions take place between study groups.

### Text

SICP comes in both print and electronic editons. Amazon sells a [new
softcover print
editon](http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871)
for about \$33. The [free online HTML
text](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) from MIT is
the most complete and functional electronic version, but there's an
[epub version](https://github.com/ieure/sicp)
([download](https://github.com/downloads/ieure/sicp/sicp.epub)) suitable
for ebook readers (Kindle, iPad, etc) available also.

### Tools

Any fully functioning Scheme interpreter will work. Most people in the
class are using [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/download/) due to its
excellent interactive debugger and friendly beginner environment.

Get this software installed to make your life easy:

-   [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/download/) IDE
-   [SICP language module](http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/) for
    DrRacket

It's also possible to use these tools:

-   [MIT Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), the
    environment the text recommends.
-   [GNU Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) (built into most
    Linux distributions, try "sudo apt-get guile" or "sudo yum install
    guile")
-   [Lisping](http://slidetocode.com/), a radical new iPad Scheme and
    Clojure programming environment

## Exercise Solutions

Several study group members are posting their solutions online:

-   [Ben's
    solutions](https://github.com/benauthor/sicp-in-sheeps-clothing),
    including some JavaScript and Python solutions
-   [Bjorn's solutions](https://github.com/bwestergard/sicp-exercises)
-   [Richard's solutions](https://github.com/obscurerichard/sicp-study)
