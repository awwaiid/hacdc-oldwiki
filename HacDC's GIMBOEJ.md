We've started an instance of [The Great Internet Migratory Box of
Electronics Junk](http://tgimboej.org/) called **[Hackerspace
Harvest](http://tgimboej.org/Box_Code:_Hackerspace_Harvest)**. As the
name suggests, it is intended to be passed among hackerspaces. We passed
it on to [Baltimore Node](http://baltimorenode.org/) on 22 September
2009.
