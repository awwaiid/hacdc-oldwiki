LulzBotMini is out of date. It now only prints rubber. Note that
instructions for using the 3D printers are in the 3D PRINTER
INSTRUCTIONS notebook (careful! - do not let the loose folders inside
fall out). The Taz works well. The Mini may have a problem with Cura;
not sure under what conditions it is usable. The Ultimaker tends to fail
on long prints. The Rostock was also failing on long prints and last
time I checked Cura won't compile for it. Does PCB Fab, USRP Software
Radio, & the Biosignal Amplifier even exist any more?
