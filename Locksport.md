### District of Columbia

Several sources I found on the web claim that mere possession of
lockpicking tools—regardless of intent—in D.C. is illegal, but I have
not seen any legal references to support that claim. The DC Code
suggests that legality is based on intent:

:   § 22-2501. Possession of implements of crime; penalty \[Formerly §
    22-3601\].
:   No person shall have in his or her possession in the District any
    instrument, tool, or implement for picking locks or pockets, with
    the intent to use such instrument, tool, or implement to commit a
    crime. Whoever violates this section shall be imprisoned for not
    more than 180 days and may be fined not more than \$1,000, unless
    the violation occurs after he or she has been convicted in the
    District of a violation of this section or of a felony, either in
    the District or another jurisdiction, in which case he or she shall
    be imprisoned for not less than one year nor more than 5 years.

It appears that the District of Columbia doesn't have any licensure
related to locksmithing.

### Maryland

The Maryland Code does not appear to prohibit mere possession of
lockpicking tools:

:   Section 6-207 - Burglary with destructive device. (a) Prohibited - A
    person may not open or attempt to open a vault, safe, or other
    secure repository by the use of a destructive device, as defined in
    § 4-501 of this article, while committing burglary in the first,
    second, or third degree. (b) Penalty - A person who violates this
    section is guilty of the felony of burglary with destructive device
    and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 20
    years. (c) Sentence - A sentence imposed for a violation of this
    section may be separate from and consecutive to or concurrent with a
    sentence for another crime based on the act establishing the
    violation of this section.

### Virginia

Possession of lockpicking tools is illegal to non-registered locksmiths.

:   Section 18.2-94 - Possession of burglarious tools, etc. If any
    person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with
    intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon conviction
    thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of
    such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other
    than a licensed dealer, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent
    to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.
