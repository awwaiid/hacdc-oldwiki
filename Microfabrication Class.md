## HacDC Microfabrication class {#hacdc_microfabrication_class}

### Dates and Times {#dates_and_times}

The class will be held remote (and possibly in the Space) bi-weekly on
Mondays ("Microfabrication Mondays") 7 to 9 PM.

## Purpose

-   Inspired by recent spate of homemade semi-conductor pioneers (Sam
    Zeloof, et al)

## Resources

-   Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
    -   Ethan currently has Cambridge SEM (for repairs) - get pumps
        working and operate the controller manually; currently doesn't
        seem to hold pressure; the vacuum is really key to getting it
        working
    -   Ethan's SEM
