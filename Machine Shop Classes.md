This page is for the machine shop classes for the space. Currently basic
lathe classes are being taught, but this may expand to include other
classes/tools as they become available. (This page is a work in
progress, please contribute!)

## Lessons Learned

List of tips gleaned from our own ~~mistakes~~ experiences. Please
contribute (with attribution / date).

-   The speed settings from the classes are suggestions only. When in
    doubt, sacrifice a small test piece to fiddle with speeds (both
    motor speed and hand speed) and find the optimal settings. (Tom C.
    10/13/10)
-   When boring and turning, it's much easier to stand at the END of the
    machine (so you're looking down the axis of the part) than to stand
    "in front" where you'd normally think to. (Tom C. 10/13/10)
-   Don't be afraid to use both hands on the dials. They're small, but
    two hands will give better control and smoother finishes. (Tom C.
    10/13/10)

## Suggestions

Suggested additions to our tool selection, classes, projects, etc.

**Operations to Learn**

-   Knurling
-   Tapered cutting

**Tools to Buy**

-   Knurling Tool

**Class Projects**

-   DIY Flashlight (VERY advanced, we may need to work up to this)
-   Control Knobs (Possibly pair with an electronics class?)
-   Aesthetics and Finishes (mini-class) - we make a handful of
    decorative rings with different tools, they make great gifts!
    -   Knurling
    -   Straight and angled grooving
    -   Polishing
-   Threading (may take some time, I (Tom) will need to teach myself
    first)

## Successful Parts!

Feel free to post up proof of your awesome part-making skills here.
Stories and photos encouraged.

I lathed up some couplers for my reprap Z axis rods. Somewhat crude in
that I used rectangular stock, but it is a vast improvement over the
plastic part that had failed. Piece is aluminium, and was drilled
through at 5mm and then drilled half way through at 8mm. I followed up
by cross drilling at 3mm and tapping for 4mm screws to secure the shafts
in the coupler. -John [Lathed motor to threaded rod

I hobbed a bolt for use in a reprap Wade's extruder. The bolt was a 5/16
x 2.5" hex head bolt that was to be used in the extruder. The bolt was
notched, then an m3 tap was put in the headstock and the bolt was hobbed
to have teeth to move the filament. A hobbing jig is in the reprap bin
for future use in case anyone else needs to create this part. The whole
procedure took less than 10 minutes. -John
