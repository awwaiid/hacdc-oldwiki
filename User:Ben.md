A decade ago, Ben Stanfield found himself at the intersection of
politics and technology as he wandered nomadically around the country
managing congressional races. But when he moved to DC 6 years ago, he
found that the intersection had become, in the grand tradition of
Lâ€™Enfant, a circle where politics and technology were joined by science,
photography and a host of smaller side streets of interest. These days,
he works as a Macintosh Server Administrator (Yes, there really are
Macintosh servers.) for a large genetics-focused governmental health
institute in Bethesda. In his spare time, he's an avid photographer,
charter member at HacDC, and serves on the Board of Directors of the
Columbia Heights Youth Club. In 2005 he founded of Draft Obama, a
national grassroots movement to convince Barack Obama to run for
President. (It worked.) Everything he writes here speaks for itself and
not on behalf of any other group, organization, person, or any of his
other personalities.

At HacDC, he's:

    a tragic miscalculation in an election decided by an epic Rochambeau
    death-battle,
