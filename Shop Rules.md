This policy, as written here:
<http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php?title=Shop_Rules&oldid=9342> , was
approved during the [Regular Member Meeting 2013 06
11](Regular_Member_Meeting_2013_06_11).

## Preface

The Shop Rules are a **guide** for neighborly conduct in the shop and a
codification of expected actions given unneighborly conduct.

## Rules

-   Clean up when you are done for the day or are leaving the space.

### Tools

-   Don't hack on tools they are not project fodder.
-   If you don't know how to use a tool ask for help.
-   If no one present knows how to use a tool ask the internet.

### Certification

-   If the tool requires [Tool
    Certifications](Tool_Certifications) then don't use it
    unless you are Certified

### Junk Disposal {#junk_disposal}

-   If a Bench space is not clean and no one present claims the Item(s)
    and there is no label/note indicating ownership or intent to return
    in a Reasonable amount of time, the Item(s) may be placed in a
    [Level 1](Junk_Bins) Junk Bin. If the Item(s) has a
    clearly labeled owner, then good faith effort should be made to
    ensure the Item(s) make it back to the owner, but may be removed
    from the bench.

## Special Cases {#special_cases}

### Bench Freeze {#bench_freeze}

-   Bench Freeze - Some projects may require Bench space for longer than
    is pragmatic for the owner to stay with the Item(s):
    -   In these cases the Bench surface should be taped off around the
        Item(s), and the tape should have:
        -   the name of the owner
        -   constraints of the Bench Freeze (start time, end time, Item
            is damaged if ...).
    -   If the Item(s) are to be left for more than 24hrs the tape
        should ideally also have:
        -   contact info
        -   directions for safe removal
    -   After the time constraints have elapsed the Items(s) should be
        removed from the Bench by one of the following:
        -   by the owner or agent thereof
        -   anyone (if needed)

## Upkeep

The Rules section of this page should be clearly posted in all areas
where it applies and/or on or near all entrances where it applies.

If the rules on this wiki page don't match posted rules they should be
updated such that the posted rules match the wiki.

## Glossary

For the compulsively pedantic among us.

-   Bench - horizontal surface that is not a part of a living thing,
    vehicle, or electronic device.
-   Bin - A container
-   Junk Bin - A Bin labeled as being a [Junk Bin](Junk_Bins)
-   Item - something that is not a bench or a living thing
-   Reasonable - passes personal nontechnical judgement
-   Certified - as per [Tool
    Certifications](Tool_Certifications). (Requirements can
    be as low as following a checklist while operating.)
