[HacDC](HacDC), [Make:DC](Make:DC) and
[DorkbotDC](DorkbotDC) are closely related groups focusing on
the intersection of art, technology, culture and craft infused with a [
DIY](:wikipedia:DIY) ethic. This article attempts to more
carefully define the symbiotic relationship between these groups.

## History

The earliest online origins of [Make:DC](Make:DC) and
[HacDC](HacDC) could be traced back to a September 18, 2007
[MAKE: Blog
post](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2007/09/nyc_resistors_microcontro.html)
by [Bre Pettis](Bre_Pettis) advertising the first meeting of
the [NYCResistor](NYCResistor) [Microcontroller Study
Group](Microcontroller_Study_Group). [Nick
Farr](User:Nickfarr) and [Adam
Koeppel](Adam_Koeppel), who would both later become
co-founders of Make:DC and HacDC, both posted to this entry stating
their intent to start an organization in [ Washington,
DC](:wikipedia:Washington,_D.C.) similar to what was being
pitched in New York City.

Shortly thereafter, Pettis encouraged Farr and Koeppel to get in touch
with [Gareth Branwyn](Gareth_Branwyn), one of Pettis's fellow
MAKE:Blog Bloggers based in the DC area. Branwyn and [Alberto
Gait&aacute;n](Alberto_Gait&aacute;n), both "co-overlords" of
DorkbotDC helped Koeppel more carefully define MakeDC's purpose and
helped secure the [Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National
Academy of Sciences](http://www.koshland-science-museum.org/) space for
[ Make:DC's first meeting/build-a-thon](MakeDC_2008-01-16), a
co-presentation that also served at that month's DorkbotDC meeting.
Koshland had previously approached Thomas Edwards, Founding Overlord of
DorkbotDC and then-recently departed to California, about collaborating
in creating programs for the museum. The build-a-thon received much
support from DorkbotDC regular R. Mark Adams, who hosted the pre-build
sessions and especially DorkbotDC regular, Tim Slagle, who created the
build's how-to, sourced and packaged the project (LED Cube) kits, wrote
example code, and ran the evening's program.

Shortly after Make:DC's first meeting, [Eric
Michaud](Eric_Michaud) encouraged his friend and former
business partner [Andrew Righter](Andrew_Righter) to meet
with Farr about building a [ hackerspace](Hackerspace) in DC.
Righter, Farr, [Alli Treman](Alli_Treman) and a host of
Righter's business colleagues and associates met at [The
Diner](http://www.trystdc.com/diner/) in [
Adams-Morgan](:wikipedia:Adams_Morgan) to discuss forming a
hackerspace in DC. Farr created the [MIBS list](MIBS_list)
shortly after the initial meeting.

From that meeting forward, Gait√°n and Branwyn offered advice and
assistance to both Make:DC and HacDC's organizational efforts. They
encouraged Farr and Koeppel to present at DorkbotDC meetings and posted
announcements about the group's activities to the DorkbotDC announce
list. The DorkbotDC announce list is credited with breaking news about
HacDC's part's party and initial organizational calls.

The relationship came full circle when DorkbotDC used the facilities
leased by HacDC at [St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal
Church](St._Stephen_and_the_Incarnation_Episcopal_Church) to
host the [Dorkbot DC meeting held on May 26.
2008](http://www.dorkbot.org/dorkbotdc/meetings/20080527.html).

## Alberto's Idea

1.  Make:DC conceptualizes projects
2.  HacDC builds them
3.  DorkbotDC presents them
4.  GoTo 1
