Oby moves to approve, Gabe seconds.

## Recognition

Calli and Gabe for running a speaker session. Ori: Relocated the
amplifier to where the microwave was. Makes the server rack much easier
to manage and move.

## New Members

None.

## Old Business

Movie night 2: Space Sweepers should happen on 8/19 or 8/20.

Scheduling new speaker sessions, discuss on:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t66hVzy2bZvO-MrppG9nrF0mB4UBEz35ygOoJhRX3Ww/edit?usp=sharing>

Educational programming, a technical literacy course; no one has
expressed interest so far, should share on blabber for a bigger
audience.

Phil's printer can be kept in the space, Oby can keep responsibility.
Should be space in the basement.

## New Business

Laser cutter moving to the basement. Move or place a second soldering
desk in basement.

Check ventilation and ethernet connection in basement.

Second server; Specs are as follows: - 2x Intel Xeon Platinum 8180s
(28C/56T) \@2.1Ghz - 8x 16GB (128GB total) DDR4 2400Mhz - 8x 960GB
Patriot Burst Elite SSD - 2x 256GB Silicon Power M.2 SSD - 2x 1300W
Intel Server PSUs - Intel Server Motherboard/2U Chassis/Riser Cards -
Nvidia Quadro RTX A4000 (16GB VRAM) Decide on how many to run in the
space.

Electricity concerns in the space had mainly been because of power
strips failing. - Mesh wrapper for some of the cables and re-organize. -
Another re-organization day on the schedule.

LAN party!! Should schedule another soon.

Possible server rack in the bathroom - ventilation? Possible leasing of
server rack space in the basement UPS (\~\$2000 value) needs special
installation of an appliance outlet.

Continue to clean out the bathroom and reclaim space, then desk can be
moved and space can become opened up much more. "Serverification" of
HacDC can include more SSH access for members also, as in the olden
days.

Record more upcoming speakers, and reclaim HacDC YouTube channel. Jitsi
recordings are limited to 1Gb. Recording can also be done on Open
Broadcaster Studio, possibly on Chris's spare gaming PC. Recordings
should be scoped to speakers, for consent & privacy concerns.

Some kind of commemorative marker for our speakers who help bring people
to our space and encourage a bigger audience.
