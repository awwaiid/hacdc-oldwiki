## Recognition

## New Members

No new members

## Old Business

-   Matt: PPE manufacturing with 3D printers still useful, dropping them
    off at local community clinics (big hospitals are doing mostly
    alright now).

## New Business

-   Potential partners with Mount Pleasant Library

-   We are looking for opportunities to be more in line with the mission
    of the church, and find ways to help them. Tayeb proposes an idea of
    having a TechSupport day offered by HacDC for either the public or
    church tenants. And volunteers himself for the job

```
-   We have not heard anything new from the District Makers, and are not
    sure if they are still active in any way. There is potential for
    setting up a shop in the basement in collaboration with them (maybe
    give them control).

```
-   Ethan Waldo has agreed to take the SEM and will work out with Don
    how to pick it up

```{=html}

```
-   How does our mission intersect with Saint Stephens? Ideas:
    -   Distance learning help for kids -- solicit computer donations to
        give to kids who don't have access
    -   Improving computer literacy course
    -   Participating in distance learning tutoring if that is possible

-   Potential for restarting movie-night: streaming or watching
    simultaneously

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports

### Project HAMRADIO - Jeff

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM)

## Member Reports

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff)

### President's Report

We have a written agreement with the church to pay a reduced rent due to
our inability to access the space. We are expected to pay \$732 per
month for use of the space until meetings of 10 attendees may be held
again at the space. If meetings greater than 10 attendees are allowed
prior to December 31st 2020, the monthly payment will return to 2017
levels (\$1043/month).

No later than December 1st 2020, HacDC and the church will discuss
HacDC's new mission, structure, financial model, and plan for increasing
membership.

The rent reduction is not to be considered permanent, it is only
temporary until the space reopens. However, the level it returns to will
be reduced from \$1646.

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

Financial Report: Current Balance -- \$3832.78 We currently have 18
paying members, \$950 from dues and an additional \$150 from donations.
We have not yet paid July rent, we are waiting for the church's response
and will likely be paying a reduced rent soon.

Taxes: We already filed with the IRS, DC no longer requires a 990N form
to be filed. Karen and Matt will figure out how to to give Matt Power of
Attorney on behalf of HacDC and make sure that we don't need to do
anything additional for filing.
