Expanding HacDC equipment to support high-end capabilites like:
Manufacturing Electronics Optics Particle Physics Semiconductor
Fabrication Biohacking Web Conferencing

Supporting these increasingly unique abilities allows us to train a new
generation of scientists and engineers, develop radically new
technology, greatly improve public relations for hackers, and further
attract new funding and talent.

The project owner (mirage335) desires to run this project
democratically, allowing all members a reasonable opportunity to push
proposals and vote. However, since the Project Tracker, fully populated
with projects and accounts, received zero participation from anyone else
after more than a year, it has been taken down. For now, a grant-style
approach is being taken.

Proposals for funds are considered, counter-proposals solicited, and an
expense or reimbursement made as appropriate. For example, one member
might propose HacDC needs a new computer. Another might suggest any new
computer purchase should support a full free software stack, including
coreboot. The project owner may then allow a short time period for a
counter-proposal to be submitted. If the counter-proposal is agreed upon
by the member submitting the original proposal, then the purchase would
likely be made.

Some current sub-project candidates for funding include.

-   OpticalTableRobot
-   Classroom CNC
-   Server hardware.
-   OpenDisplay
-   Metal Casting
