-   Internet service - how to pay Mobile Citizen? how to get
    connection/installation instructions? who will setup our service
    with Mobile Citizen & when?
-   Phone service -
    -   Jamie: "You should be able to set-up the adapters to register
        directly w/ Twilio now (I think they implemented that in 2017
        or 2018) in which case the voip.ms account can probably be
        dropped."
    -   Jamie: "So first course of business, find the adapters (or has
        HacDC moved to VOIP phones) and figure out the logins to them or
        reset them and set-up an elastic SIP trunk on Twilio."
    -   Mobile Citizen phone service annual bill + adaptor = \$411.95
        (\$282.00 for adaptor, \$120.00 for annual membership, \$9.95
        shipping)
    -   Accounts for Twillio and VoIP.ms details recovered
    -   There's been a recommendation for [Vtech VCS754 ErisStation
        Conference Phone with 4 Wireless Microphones VoIP and
        Device](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012E9LV7A/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0)
        but we have a [Polycom](https://www.poly.com/us/en) SoundStation
        (obsolete) in the space.
-   Machine Learning by Doing Night is merging with Open Project Night.
    However the Discord channel will remain.
-   [HetrixTools](https://hetrixtools.com/report/uptime/84277c0d5d940bb3d8351a0d14ac9020/)
    warns of an expiring SSL certificate on wiki.hacdc.org

    multimeters, etc.)

    members](On-Boarding_New_Members)
-   Finances
    -   Current balance as of April 1: \$19,493
    -   Currently expenses slightly more than revenues. So, "be
        careful".
-   Ideas for increasing revenue:
    -   Michelle in her At Large position working on recruiting and
        modeling after [John Hopkins Fast Forward Innovation
        Hub](https://ventures.jhu.edu/programs-services/fastforward/)
    -   Max is suggesting getting fancy graphic cards (GPUs) for AI,
        etc. Lots of activity on Discord
    -   Gabe says having events in the space is what's drawing in new
        blood
    -   If someone offers to donate equipment, it needs a member sponsor
        to maintain it, promote it and use it. Otherwise "No" as we
        don't want stuff sitting idle.
    -   Michelle wants to bring back Movie Night
        -   In house? At a theater? Food?
        -   Is the church still having a pest problem? Find out about
            the church tenants meeting.
        -   "D&D" in theaters and "Tetris" in the space?
        -   What night?
        -   Maybe something at [Suns Cinema](https://sunscinema.com/)?
        -   See Discord poll posted by Michelle (April 11, 2023 20:24)
