Why not include the commands for:

-   You've checked the Porteus .xzm modules we built for Byzantium out
    of SVN, installed, and enabled them.
-   You've checked the source tree for Byzantium out of the Git
    repository.

Also, if porteus doesn't provide sudo, then... you must be root? In that
case why not just omit "sudo" and note at the beginning of the page that
you must be root?

And THEN, if all that is ok, why not just line them all up in a script
and say "hey, download and run this script as root on a clean install of
porteus!" --[Xaqrox](User:Xaqrox) 20:19, 10 October 2011

The Slackware sudo package is now in SVN. --[The
