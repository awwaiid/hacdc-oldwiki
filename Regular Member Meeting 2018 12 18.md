### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

A relatively normal month for HacDC, we are in the final month of
recovering past dues for members, so approximately \$180 per month we
were getting before will no longer be coming. We are in the third
consecutive month of net losses, around \$300 dollars per month This
isn't terribly worrisome yet, because we have enough money to cover rent
for many more months, but that along with the rent increase is worrisome
so it's good we are talking about fundraising ideas.
