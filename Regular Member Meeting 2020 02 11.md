    Services (DOES), and pitching HacDC to the assembled masses.

    Lasercutter](Cheap_Chinese_Laser).

    wallets, with their [Capture the
    Flag](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) sessions.

## New Members {#new_members}

## Old Business {#old_business}

-   Spring cleaning (but not gear cleaning) has begun. Clean those
    springs!

## New Business {#new_business}

-   Once again, we've had an offer of space at the [USA Science and
    Engineering Festival](https://usasciencefestival.org/) April 25-26,
    2020 at the Convention Center. We need to determine what to do, and
    gather the troops / troupe to do it.
-   A possible visit to [Nonstop Art](https://www.nonstopart.co/) (**web
    site currently "out of order"**) in their new digs at [**THEARC**
    (**T**own **H**all **E**ducation **A**rts **R**ecreation
    **C**ampus)](https://bbardc.org/project/thearc/) is in the works.
-   A rerun of the [Deep Learning: Machine Learning & AI course (study
    group)](https://www.meetup.com/NeuroTechDC/events/265826648/) is in
    the offing.
-   A modest proposal from Tristin, paraphrased: Reduce the perks of
    non-members. Non-members don't get to use the equipment. They can
    show up with their own laptop and hang out, but to use equipment and
    tools, one has to be a member. Even without the means of
    enforcement, having the rule in place, and some self-enforcement
    might encourage people to pay up.
-   Also from Tristin (again, paraphrased): We should not be hamstrung
    by the current rules into a situation where changing the bylaws is
    nigh on impossible.

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project HAMRADIO - Jeff {#project_hamradio___jeff}

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM) {#project_electron_microscope_sem}

-   Half of the SEM is now, gutted, "vertically oriented" and
    precariously balanced -- off-center on a dolly loaned by Don.
-   The other half, Tristin has laid claim to.

#### Kevin

-   The vestibule light has been replaced.
-   The BOD set of basement keys has been returned to the BOD locker.
-   Ken hobbed and I knobbed (or vice-versa) at the Quarterly
    Stakeholders Meeting of the [DC Department of Employment Services
    (DOES)](https://does.dc.gov/). My sense is that the most promising
    outcome will be via the [DC Infrastructure Academy
    (DCIA)](https://dcinfrastructureacademy.org/). However, I also made
    one contact there who says he **MAY** be able to find us bigger,
    better space at another church for "cheap". I wrote to him asking
    for a follow-up on the specifics before he attempts to lobby on our
    behalf. I have not heard back yet.
-   I hobbed and Ken knobbed (or vice-versa) at a meeting of the [DC
    Public Schools](https://dcps.dc.gov/) Librarians meeting, this month
    featuring "makerspaces". Although there was repeated
    misunderstanding of who and what we are, I hope we finally got
    through to them that this is not a full-time business with paid
    staff. Some promised to stop by and find out more about us. I think
    everyone, other than Ken and I, were elementary school or middle
    school librarians wanting to bring boatloads of kids on field trips
    to the space.
-   The wiki and the main site have both been upgraded to the latest and
    greatest. Alas, changes in the way Meetup does business has forced
    the removal of the calendar from the main site. However, I believe I
    have a work-around. In the meantime, both
    [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/hac-dc/events/calendar/) itself, and
    the wiki main page "10-event look ahead" are still working. (I plan
    to rejigger the code I wrote for the wiki event list and apply it to
    WordPress, but it will take some study.)
-   After some pestering, and public shaming on Twitter, our SSL secure
    connection certificate has been renewed again.

#### Ken

-   The invite to Quarterly Stakeholders Meeting of the DC Department of
    Employment Services (DOES) was from my contact at Infrastructure
    Academy. Combined with Kevin's contact at the Academy this should
    help us to explore supporting a program there, perhaps working with
    other DC Makerspaces to support a small Makerspace at the Academy.
-   DC Public Schools Librarians meeting attended by Kevin and I. I am
    sending out information on two previous efforts involving kids and
    making to the originator of the Librarians meeting. The first effort
    involved supporting an Aquaponics project at Anacostia High School.
    The second effort supported sessions in a Ward 8 summer program,
    with kids aged 6-12, where they learned about robots, sensors,
    microcontrollers, etc. HacDC supported both efforts.
