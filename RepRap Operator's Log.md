-   Dec 20, 2010. (Elliot) A while ago, printed out a brutstruder head
    for the reprap.

    Assembled, installed, and tested it out last night, and it's a
    winner. Bought a new gearmotor to replace the old one which was slow
    and spineless. The thermistor is installed, but I haven't tweaked
    the relevant settings in the firmware, and not sure that I know how,
    so the hot end appears to be still running open-loop. This is no
    good.

-   Nov 27, 2010. (Elliot) I finally got up the courage/stupidity to
    completely remove, disassemble, clean, and re-install the hot end on
    the reprap extruder. Photos and documentation are at [Rebuilding the
    RepRap Hot End](Rebuilding_the_RepRap_Hot_End). The short
    version is that now it's nicely free-flowing and the extrusion speed
    is limited by the motor (slow!). I also added a 100k thermistor
    taped to the nozzle (a la makerbot) but I don't know how to
    re-integrate it into the machine. I also may have left too much of
    the insulation near the nozzle. If it tears/drags, feel free to trim
    it.
