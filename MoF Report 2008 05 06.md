# Budget

## Membership Dues

The general proposal under discussion is \$42/month for 2008 with waiver
procedure as drafted in the Bylaws. PayPal cleared us today, so we can
start collecting member dues. Minus PayPal fees, planning for
\$1,200/month for rent, internet and insurance, this means we need to
have 30 members to maintain the space.

Already, we have 6 members so we need to find 24 more dues paying
members.

Of course, anyone will be encouraged to [donate](Donation)
more. Everything beyond \$42 is tax deductible.

## Budget Principles Proposal

-   Our Monthly Expenses (Rent, Insurance, Internet, Basic Supplies)
    shall remain under a fixed amount per month to be fully fundable by
    member dues.
-   Membership dues alone must be able to cover the space's minimal
    expenses
-   Anything raised beyond expenses, be it through a "soda fund", the
    sale of recycled equipment, etc (and not restricted to a cause)
    should go towards group-wide goals approved at a meeting

## Budget Proposals

### HiDeUS (High Density Unit of Shelving) - \$500

I authorized a budget of \$400 for the initial construction. I propose a
budget of \$500.00 for finishing off the shelf, however, we need to
raise May Dues to pay for May Rent first.

### Compliance Paperwork - \$1,003.00 {#compliance_paperwork___1003.00}
