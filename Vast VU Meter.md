This is an existing personal project I'm building a prototype for to
pitch to my university. I plan to work out the kinks in the HacDC space.
I've laid this out pretty thoroughly on [my
blog](http://www.phrontist.org/?cat=15). Here is a quick synopsis:

> I want to take a row of windows (or more, as money allows) in the
> building and place lamps in them to form a vertical bar VU meter
> showing the volume of the radio station's broadcast. You could tune in
> to the station during the evening and watch this huge column of light
> on the face of \[a 22 story building on campus\] leap up and down in
> synchrony with the music. You could tune in to the station during the
> evening and watch this huge column of light on the face of POT leap up
> and down in synchrony with the music. The signal we want to represent
> is already available as radio broadcast on every floor. So instead of
> switching a huge number of lights from a central system, we can put a
> radio on each floor and have each set of lights switched autonomously
> in response to the signal it receives.

> So the basic plan is to have a simple lamp with, lets say, three 100
> watt bulbs in each window. You have a relay that can switch the bulbs
> on and off quickly in response to a low voltage signal. This signal is
> provided by a simple circuit that detects how loud the signal coming
> from the radio is, and while it’s above a certain threshold, activates
> the relay to turn on the lamps. By setting that threshold slightly
> higher on each successive floor, you’ll get that VU meter effect.
