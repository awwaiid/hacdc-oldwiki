*This book is a collection of details surrounding the beginning of your
hacker space. If you’d like to just tell the story in 500 words, that’s
fine. We’ve put together the questions below and so if you like, you can
just answer them as best you can and send them back and that should give
the world a glimpse into the beginning of your hackerspace! Again, total
word count should be around 500. Understand that we’re going to be
editing these entries for content and length.*

*Tell the story of the beginning of the hackerspace. How did you come up
with the idea? How did you choose the name of your hackerspace? What was
your original vision?*

*What are some obstacles that you had to overcome at the beginning of
your hackerspace when you were just getting started?*

*Describe your hackerspace. What do visitors to the space notice that is
special about the space? What kind of tools and resources do you have at
the space?*

*How often do you meet? What happens at these meetings?*

*Describe a disaster that occurred in your hackerspace. (flood,
lightning, accident or some such thing)*

*What are some things that have come out of your hackerspace that you
are most proud of?*

*Was there anything that you did that was essential to the start of your
hackerspace? Do you have any advice for people who might be thinking of
starting a hackerspace?*

# Photos

*We need 5 or more photos of your space. At least 300dpi and 2″x3″ or
larger in JPG or EPS format. If possible, it would be great to see a few
photos of people working in your space. If you have photos of your
hackerspace already, please send them ASAP so Astera can start color
correcting them and getting them into indesign.*

It's a shame we don't have any photos from the [Microcontroller
Course](Microcontroller_Course). We should definitely take
some in the next session of it!

# Logo Image

*We need a logo from your hackerspace ideally in a vector format like
.eps or .ai.*

Nick - can you provide this?

# BONUS POINTS

*If you get this all done and feel like going an extra mile you could do
one of the following. Don’t do these if they will put you over the
deadline.*

-   Get members to tell a story or recount an adventure associated with
    the beginning of your hackerspace.
-   Draw a floor diagram.
-   Include a manifesto.
