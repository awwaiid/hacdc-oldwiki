`<span style="font-size:large; line-height:1.5em; color:#222">`{=html}Welcome
to HacDC. We are a hacker space located in Washington, DC. HacDC members
improve the world by creatively rethinking technology. We break, build,
and occasionally abuse technology in the pursuit of greater knowledge
about how it works and repurposing it to build new things. Our shop is
located in the
\[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Heights%2C_Washington%2C_D.C>.
Columbia Heights\] neighborhood of DC.`</span>`{=html}

If you're new here, you should start by looking at our public web site
at [hacdc.org](http://www.hacdc.org/). Our Wiki is mostly for internal
organization, but you're welcome to look through to get a sense of what
we work on (and consider joining yourself!). We invite you to subscribe
to our [announcement](http://www.hacdc.org/mailman/listinfo/announce)
