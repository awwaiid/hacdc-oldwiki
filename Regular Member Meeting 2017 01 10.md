## New Business

### February 11: Request for Participation at MLK (DCPL) tech event

-   **RSVP ASAP** February 11: D.C. Public Library asking for HacDC
    participation in a "Teen Techathon" for Black History Month. But
    they wanted a Google form filled out by January 1 !!! When I
    contacted them and said "Jan 1? Are you nuts???" we received a "stay
    of execution" because we would be a "booth" at the event. Still,
    expediency would be appreciated. Since they already have a Fab Lab
    with 3D printers, laser cutters, wire bender, etc. perhaps Space
    Blimps, ham radios, or interesting microprocessor stuff would fit
    better.

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports

### Project SUPPLIES

Reminded our treasurer of some un-reimbursed expenses.

### Project EXPANSION

No activity to report.

### Project HAMRADIO

We have a meeting tomorrow. We can give a more full report then.

In terms of what we are doing: many participations in National Parks on
the Air in 2016, support for marathons, and the upcoming Million Woman
March on January 21. We have a community lunch once a month, offer free
testing for people who seek to become licensed hams, and are
implementing our "Paper Ham Initiative" so that people who are licensed
but who have never been on the air get to have real on-air experience.
We are setting up a satellite station at the Armed Forces Retirement
Home, one of the highest points in DC.

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM)

Vacuum gauge is supposed.... to ship in January... supposed to

### Project Optical Table Robot (OTR)

### Project CRISPR

Nothing new to report. I purchased more DNA/RNA and E.Coli. The
classroom fridge was found ajar some time ago,so all its DNA/RNA might
be suspect and better trashed anyway. Will meet to discuss CRISPR
Thursday night. CRISPR event planning is a bit on the back-burner
because of the cryptoparty I'm also doing.(enrique)

### Project SpaceBlimp

Video still not edited /not on YouTube. Seems after doing it people
don't care about presenting it so much. :\\

## Member Reports

-   We now have a NinjaFlex extruder head for the Lulzbot Mini. When and
    how to test it out, TBD. (*ubuntourist*)
-   The cryptoparty is Saturday, January 28 from 10am to 4pm. We have
    three or four HacDC speakers and three or four invited speakers. We
    could use some help! We should make a flyer and start printing it
    and putting it up to spread the word, the day of we'll want to set
    up WiFi in the auditorium, arrange projectors, chairs & tables,
    order pizza and collect pizza payments and donations, etc, heeeelp!

## Director Reports

### President's Report

`   PoHacDC regales us with tales of 31c3.`

`   Also announces the Annual Meeting will be held J28th at 4pm.`

### Vice President's Report

`   Ethan has resigned as a member.`

### Treasurer's Report

We finished 2017 with roughly \$8,000 in reserves (6-7 months) and
\$4,500 in project earmarks (mostly OTR), so about \$12,500 in the bank.
Our revenue is very reliant on membership dues (about \$17,500) despite
more donations than usual (\$2,500 this year) and \$500 in sponsorship.

We were in the black December to the tune of \$228. I'm also revising
November; we did \$300 better than I'd calculated before, so \$344 in
the black. Not sure where the spreadsheet mistake was. Since reserves
are fine, I'm allocating the surplus for both months (\$572) to Project
Awesome projects. I haven't calculated the dividends and balances yet
though. In fact I'm getting tired of doing that. It's a whole other
spreadsheet.

As usual, the rent is going up. Starting soon it will be 5% more and
we'll be about \$50/mo closer to breaking even. I believe we lost two
members in December (Jamie and probably Sumter) and gained two new ones
(Ben and Andrew).

Tomorrow (Wed) night I'm going to a free legal clinic hosted by DC
Pro-Bono Bar (hat-tip to ArteTechnica). The main reason is that last
year's donations exceeded the threshold where you need a solicitation
license (\$1,500), so we should probably get one and check any other
paperwork so HacDC can qualify for grants in the future.

### Secretary's Report

Happy New Year. Hope we can have an excellent 2017.

Since becoming secretary I've been a regular attendee at our weeknight
workshops and started hosting a generic consumer (PC) hardware
build/teardown/rebuild meetup on Sundays. Attendance has been sparse at
the new time but I hope to grow this class in 2017 and add it to our
lineup of regular events to draw attendees.

I've also been working with Julia to comission our new classroom laser
cutter. I believe this is immanent, pending only hooking up the outdoor
ventilation. When this is done I hope to move on to more interesting
projects. Such as a Martian Basalt 3d Printer? And making the basement
OTR great again (and yes, Mexico's gonna pay for it!).

Fear your neighbor. MAGA.

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### Mike

#### Matt

We lost the test cart facility due to an honest communication fumble
between three reasonable people who most likely would not have
undertaken the disassembly on their own. For the future, we can do
better.

Aside from that, HacDC has had a good year, getting back on its feet.
Next year, we may be able to focus on growth.
