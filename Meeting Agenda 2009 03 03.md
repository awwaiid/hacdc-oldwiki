## Draft minutes of the last meeting {#draft_minutes_of_the_last_meeting}

*Was there a meeting on 10 February? That would have been the most
recent regular (i.e., non-Annual) meeting, since 17 February was the day
after a federal holiday, and 24 February was a Dorkbot DC meeting. There
aren't any minutes for any meetings since last year, though. -
