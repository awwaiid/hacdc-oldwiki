HacDC works on various projects. Each project should be well represented
in the [HacDC Blog](http://www.hacdc.org) as well as the [ HacDC
Wiki](Main_Page). Please use the following convention when
presenting a new project:

Starting a project

1.  Submit a blog post about the project. File the post under the
    [Projects](http://hacdc.org/category/projects/) category and add any
    relevant tags
2.  Create a Wiki Page for the project
3.  Populate your project Wiki page with content about your project
4.  Add the project to either
    [:Category:Ongoing_Projects](:Category:Ongoing_Projects)
    (if you intend to work on the project) or
    [:Category:Proposed_Projects](:Category:Proposed_Projects)
    (if you think others might enjoy working on it). Just add the
    correct tags (as shown here) to the bottom of your entry to properly
    categorize it:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    [[Category:Ongoing_Projects]] [[Category:Proposed_Projects]]

Once an ongoing project is active

-   The [website admins](mailto:web@hacdc.org) will add your project to
    the relevant static project page on [HacDC.org](http://hacdc.org)
-   [ Ongoing projects](:Category:Ongoing_Projects) will be
    expected to submit a weekly report for the weekly meeting. Failure
    to submit reports for a certain period of time will result in an
    Ongoing Project being classified as an [ Abandoned
    Project](:Category:Abandoned_Projects).
