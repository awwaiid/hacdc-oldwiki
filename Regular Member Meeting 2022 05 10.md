## Old Business

1.  Basement cleanup - "peel back the onion" of this large project to
    make progress this year; several did "Part 1 of 2" in April (?)
    weekend, going to do "Part 2 of 2" with volunteers in June.
    Organizers: John, Brian, and Michelle. John would like to see a
    facility that supports what people actually need in the future. Oby
    thinks "machine shop" is best-case-scenario for basement and more
    specialty stuff down there. Water wasn't present there, but still
    does occur when it rains heavily - see Mike/replacement to see if he
    did what he said and created a barrier to prevent it from getting
    wet. Safety concerns: chemicals in basement, possible mold even
    though cannot smell (may need mold detector & dehumidifiers / Brian
    thinks there are two dehumidifiers). Removing the 1-ton optical
    table or create an island with machine shop - either way need to
    remove the shelves (and the stuff on them) to make more room to
    move. Michelle will send out poll for June 4-5 or June 11-12.
2.  Discuss purchase of new filament - Mostly inexpensive, need
    semi-clear plastic box that seals, need anhydrous dessicant
    (reusable beads), need two gallon ziploc baggies, and then lastly
    need the filament (PLA, PETG, couple rolls of Ninjaflex). Potential
    supplier: <https://www.villageplastics.com/>
