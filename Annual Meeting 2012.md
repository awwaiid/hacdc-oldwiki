# Officer Reports {#officer_reports}

## President's Report {#presidents_report}

Not present.

## Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

Has some ideas for events and stuff to be mentioned later.

XLaser mentioned the would send us another package of laser stuff, but
never did. (Sharks with freaking laser beams.)

## Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

Currently have 59 voting members so quorum is still 14 for now.

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for Jan 2012:
<file:HacDC_Financials_Jan_2012.pdf>

We added members Scott Robbins and Stephen Nichols in January. Vince was
voted in but has not paid yet as far as I know - please contact me if
this is incorrect! And we added three other membership subscriptions
(Chalk, Hughes, and Myers) but have not voted on them as members yet as
well - maybe this month? Two non-paying members, one hasn't responded
and may be dropping.

We finished January almost \$500 ahead and membership revenue is now \>=
expenses! If this keeps up, HacDC will have some resources to put into
projects again going forward.

## Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

## Brad

Smithsonian Institute has contacted Brad about 3D vision stuff. It would
be cool to have a hackathon here to help out. Talk on Blabber if you're
interested. Would like to have an event where we take pictures of
objects at the Smithsonian, turn them into 3d models, and print them out
with the printers at the space.
