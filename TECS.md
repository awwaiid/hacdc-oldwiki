# The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

## Course Overview

Copied from course-provided syllabus: The course objective is to
integrate key topics from algorithms, computer architecture, operating
systems, compilers, and software engineering, in one unified framework.
This will be done constructively, by building a general-purpose computer
system from the ground up. In the process, we will explore many ideas
and techniques used in the design of modern hardware and software
systems, and discuss major trade-offs and future trends. Throughout this
journey, you will gain many cross-section views of the computing field,
from the bare bone details of switching circuits to the high level
abstraction of object-based software design.

## Prerequisites

1.  A copy of the book is highly recommended. It can be purchased from
    [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262640686/ref=oss_product)
    for less than ~~\$30~~ **\$20**. Most of the chapters can also be
    downloaded as PDFs from [the books
    website](http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html).
2.  A computer to run the examples and assignments. The course software
    is written in Java so it will run on Windows, Linux or Mac.
3.  Some programming experience is recommended. Any programming language
    can be used for the projects in the book.

## Software

The software necessary for the course is freely available from the books
website: [1](http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/)

## Lecture

We will be using the syllabus provided by the book which follows the
chapters in order. The lecture/discussion will loosely follow the slides
provided on the course website.

### List of Lectures

This is the proposed schedule based on the course-provided syllabus.
Changes are likely to happen and I will try to keep this updated to
reflect those. Let me know if any of these dates need to altered. I will
be at the space by 7:00p but lecture typically begins at 7:30p.

## Methodology

Copied from course-provided syllabus: This is mostly a hands-on course,
which evolves around implementing a series of hardware and software
modules. Each module development task will be accompanied by a design
document and an executable solution (illustrating what the module is
supposed to do), a detailed implementation document (proposing how to
build it), and a test script (specifying how to test it). The homework
assignments will be spread out evenly, so there will be no special
“crunch” toward the semester’s end. Each lecture will start by reviewing
the work that was done thus far, and giving instructions on what has to
be done next. The homework assignments can be done in pairs.

Each week/chapter is completely modular and self-contained. It is not
necessary to complete an earlier chapter in order to participate in a
later one. Therefore students are free follow along in whichever order
they choose or audit only those weeks that are of interest to them.
