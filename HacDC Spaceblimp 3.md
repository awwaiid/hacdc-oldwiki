## Photos

Spaceblimp 3 went up with two still cameras and a non-functioning video
camera. There are tons of neat pics from both. These links get you into
the series right before liftoff.

-   [Camera two:
    liftoff](http://gallery.jbwa.net/SpaceBlimp/SB3/Camera2/?g2_page=6)

These are about as far out as we got before the balloon popped:

-   [Camera one:
    space!](http://gallery.jbwa.net/SpaceBlimp/SB3/Camera1/?g2_page=30)
-   [Camera two:
    space!](http://gallery.jbwa.net/SpaceBlimp/SB3/Camera2/?g2_page=38)

And then, recovery:

## The Dataz! (Telemetry)

-   Accelerometer data. Unfortunately, it looks like there was a bug in
    the code and the second half of the data overwrote the first.
    Anyway, here it is. It's 100 samples per second, start time unknown,
    but it looks like it captures the pop, some freefall, and the
    landing. [Media:AccelerometerDumpfile 2010-11-13

## Help Wanted:

If you spot something you can handle or wish to learn about, we'd love
to have your help. (Seriously, meeting more people like
`<u>`{=html}you`</u>`{=html} is major goal of HacDC.)

-   Blog about upcoming flight
-   Document [HacDC Spaceblimp 1](HacDC_Spaceblimp_1) on wiki
-   Build primary & secondary beacon antenna
-   Altimeter selection & purchase
-   Purchase 32 GB SDHC memory card for video
-   Build battery pack for video
-   Make weatherproof labels/tags for capsule recovery (laminate, 3d
    print, laser cut, etc.)
-   Work on CHDK scripts for still cameras
-   Build capsule/rigging/chute
-   Vacuum test Geiger counter
-   New software for additional sensors (add small Î¼C?)
