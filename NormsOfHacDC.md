# Opportunities

AWESOME THINGS TO DO!

HacDC offers exceptional access to high-tech expertise, tools, and
supplies, for education and research. Many of our guests, members, and
research projects are where they are today because people can, and do,
collaborate, operate tools, and use supplies, effectively, without
formal training, without certification, and without purchasing supplies
outright.

HacDC members, and their guests, can dive right into advanced
techniques, with or without prior experience, by self-learning or
exploring, often interacting with expensive tools or one-of-a-kind
research equipment. Many of us learned CNC milling or 3D printing just
by reading the wiki page, and were proficiently operating within less
than a day. Some of the best tools in existence were built by us, then
freely shared with others, both in the space, and on the internet, as
open-source projects. Much, if not most, of our equipment was developed
by our members learning every step of the way!

Our tools and supplies are generally free of charge to members and
guests alike. Likewise, borrowing our stuff is ok too. Even though we
are a non-profit, some personal use is acceptable. You can even use the
3D printer, consuming some filament for free! (Though of course
donations are always welcome - our big expense is rent.)

We have not had major problems with such open policies, proving that
they can work, and can be highly productive for public benefit.
Permanent injuries have not happened, tools have not been damaged in
operation, and minimal supplies budgets have not remotely been drained.
Meanwhile, typically hundreds of events per year, typically including
thousands of guests per year, have expanded the public's technological
proficiency, and many dozens of successful research projects (most
notably Project Byzantium) have gone on to provide real benefit to the
real world.

# Expectations

Be polite. Be efficient.

We are of course not an uptight group, we are not going to revoke your
membership (not even dues-waived) when you obviously could have meant
well, and could make things work. These are just some bits of advice to
minimize confusion and learn good habits.

If you do have a dues-waived membership, please do not feel "obligated"
to contribute. Generally, these have been granted on the basis of
inability to pay, rather than specific expectation of contribution.

Tryhards in general are not really helpful. Far better to contribute
when you can, or just have the patience to slowly learn how to do
things, than to play the hero, taking control, blowing a trumpet at
every opportunity, alienating volunteers. Remember, in the open source
world, benevolent dictators hold their positions only because they have
learned to do what they do so well.

Some equipment and projects may be labeled "do not hack", "do not
discard", or similar, ideally with a date and a phone number. If in
doubt as to what the label states, it is best to contact the person
written on the label.

Our community members are all familiar to each other. If someone who
works on a project or tool at the space is not available, just reach out
to other members in the space,
[#hacdc@irc.freenode.net](http://chat.hacdc.org/) , blabber@hacdc.org ,
members@hacdc.org , and bod@hacdc.org .

In fact, the world of technically inclined people is actually quite
small. Most HacDC members are one or two degrees of freedom from
"famous" people you may have heard of - core Linux kernel developers,
core Implicit CAD maintainers, core LulzBot 3D printer developers, core
SeeMeCNC developers - and others. Really, you might be surprised how
accessible these people are at hacker/makerspaces, conferences, and more
formally, through GitHub, IRC, and email, in contrast with more
traditional "celebrities".

Please consider updating the [appropriate wiki
page](https://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/Category:What_I_Stole) when
borrowing tools (not supplies). Not only is it polite, it provides a
record of your intention to bring it back.

If somehow, someone builds something you do not like, it is much better
to ask for what you do want, than to attack their work. Remember, we are
all volunteers, we are here because we want to be, which means if the
community is hostile, it can't work. As a specific example, if someone
successfully recommissions a broken tool, and it doesn't look as user
friendly as you might want, consider asking for user friendly features
you might want, such as an enclosure, rather than attacking the project
itself.

# Harassment

We have rarely, if ever, have had to enforce this. Just remember HacDC
is a public space.

[Anti-Harassment_Policy](Anti-Harassment_Policy)

Members of the board of directors and event organizers will happily help
members and visitors contact building security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
feel safe and prevent harassment for the duration of their visit at
HacDC. We value your attendance.

# Disruption

What you cannot do, or allow your guests to do, or allow anything else
you are responsible for to do, in the space.

HacDC does have a specific non-profit mission to provide education and
research, as an official 501(c)3. We do not have the resources to
support off mission activities.

Don't worry though, there is a huge gap between reasonable, on-mission,
and not. The vast majority of human beings, acting mostly or entirely
rationally, would never even think of perpetrating such major incidents.
However, describing them may help illustrate just how much latitude
legitimate activities do have in practice, as well as provide a sense of
fairness to those who may claim not to understand having gone too far.

-   HacDC **is** a public space, a 501(c)3 non-profit, for education and
    research, with just enough resources to support collaboration and
    exceptionally open access policies.
-   HacDC is **not** a homeless shelter, a mental institution, a place
    for exclusive self-promotion, a place for threats, or a place to
    make others do your bidding.
-   HacDC **cannot** have members or guests who refuse to, or are
    incapable of, following a few basic safety rules, or the most
    fundamental common sense. HacDC's few explicit rules are mostly part
    of our lease, and provide a good illustration of their seriousness.
    Overnight sleeping (without permission), compromising building
    security at night (putting minors at risk), and smoking (fire
    hazard, no sprinklers), are absolutely forbidden.

```{=html}

```
-   HacDC, as a 501(c)3 non-profit, has a specific mission. Our
    resources are optimized to provide expertise, tools, and supplies
    on-site, to enable all ages to achieve competence in the modern
    real-world of research and development projects.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   HacDC's resources are not suitable for other purposes, even other
    charitable purposes.
-   Not a homeless shelter. While we do not discriminate against
    homeless, we must require their specific needs be met elsewhere. We
    cannot allow overnight sleeping (lease restriction), our space is
    limited (obstacle to volunteers), and our resources cannot be
    diverted to personal use (maintenance hours on big display going to
    daytime TV reception).
-   Not a mental institution. Again, while we do not discriminate
    against people with mental illness, we must require their specific
    needs be met elsewhere. Our lab is not a safe padded room, our tools
    cannot be productively rearranged for magic, our members have at
    least minimal requirements for order, and our lease prohibits
    smoking in the building, among other considerations.
-   Not a place for exclusive self-promotion. Non-profits are owned by
    the public. Anyone refusing to attempt to include current project
    leadership while representing that project's operations/schedule
    cannot be allowed to claim to represent it as a participant (meaning
    access to participate at the space must barred). Improperly
    scheduling someone else's event in particular can reflect extremely
    poorly on the community as a whole. Refusing to attempt to
    coordinate with current project leadership, misrepresenting the
    project's operations/schedule, and alienating the workforce behind
    the project, is not a contribution to put on a resume.
-   Not a place for threats. Anyone showing live ammunition, bragging
    about the ability to destroy things in the space, must leave.
    Likewise, political discussions about serious physical injury
    needing to happen to someone you disagree with, must be stopped
    immediately.
-   Not a place for flaming volunteers. Not cool to start a flamewar
    because, after over a year, volunteers succeeded in doing something
    for you, just not quite the way you thought would be pretty. Ask for
    features, don't slam good work.

Actionable problems are quite rare, mostly far in the distant past, and
we have been improving our ability to enforce reasonable conduct.
