This page represents the current Equipment procurement priority of
HacDC. Questions to contemplate when determining priority should be as
follows:

1.  Will it serve the entire group? (i.e Tables, Chairs, Projector)
2.  Will it serve the most active projects?
3.  Is it necessary to facilitate a potential project or general group
    comfort?
4.  Can we get it [donated](Donation)?
5.  Can we afford it now, and if not, can we set aside a special fund?
    (i.e. Why save for a projector when we need chairs?)

## Equipment

Equipment is purchased (or reimbursed) in the priority below when funds
become available in the Equipment budget.

Once any piece of equipment is purchased a Wiki article about is proper
care, use and storage should be created. If special training is required
to use a particular tool, those authorized to use the tool should be
added to the (protected) Wiki page.

With the exception of restricted funds (where we set aside money for a
certain piece of major equipment) all funding in the tools budget shall
be spent in the following order of priority

## Parts & Inventory

Parts and [Inventory](Inventory) are supplies that HacDC
carries to facilitate its projects. Things like coffee and snacks for
late-night electronics work, in addition to solder, electronics parts
and whatever we can pull from the free parts bin fall under this
category.

Eventually, we should have drinks, beverages, whatever food, [certain
parts and expendable materials that can be purchased on an as-needed
basis](Components_Store). These should be paid for by the
members and not have to be replenished, per se, by group funds.

## Special Funds

The following special funds have been set aside to purchase major tools.
