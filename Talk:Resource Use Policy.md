I'm not sure where questions go, but here is something for discussion:
What's the policy on members taking parts and stuff for there personal
projects? On one hand it would be nice to have shared solder and a grab
bag of resisters and screws and bolts without having to bring that
stuff. But on the other hand, if someone contributes valuable stuff,
like a working Roomba, a handful of servo's, or a small bag of
MicroPICs, are they up for grabs for anyone to put in there project and
take home? --[DLotts](User:DLotts) 07:50, 28 April 2008 (UTC)

Good call! I added more stuff to this resource use policy. Do you think
what I have down answers the
question?--[Nickfarr](User:Nickfarr) 17:53, 28 April 2008

Hot damn, I like the revised and shortened version! Nick, it'd be
helpful if you were signed in during all your edits. Aside from that, it
looks great! I'm gonna add one thing to the tool policy tho...
