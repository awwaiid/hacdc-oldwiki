## Director Reports

### President's Report

Tommy Johnson would like his engine hoist returned as soon as possible.

### Vice President's Report

None.

### Treasurer's Report

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for June 2014:
![](HacDC_Financials_2014_06.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2014_06.pdf"). We did
not gain any new members. In May we lost three members: Ann Millspaugh,
Griffin Boyce, and Sharad Satsangi. In June we lost Ken Kenworthy and
Kasia Whiteis. We have 42 dues-paying members in good standing, 8
dues-waived members, and 4 members who are behind on dues.

#### Project Awesome

Here is the Project Awesome spreadsheet for June:
![](HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_06.pdf "HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_06.pdf"). We
continue to have to dip into savings to pay our rent, so no dividend
this month. :(

### Secretary's Report

HOPE X is coming up. I have a spare bed in my room if you need a place
to crash.

We have mesh radios on the roof that might actually be able to connect
to things!

Toast is going to come pick up the unused arcade machine.

### Director-at-Large Reports

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports

### Project LASER

Dan cleaned the laser again, printing much better but not perfect. Don't
cut particle board!

### Project BYZANTIUM

The ISC published an article recognizing the work we did last year for
the grant.

We are working with HARC to mesh-connect the space.

We spent some money on HARC/Byzantium-related equipment for the mesh
radios on the roof. Like outdoor-rated Cat 5E STP and connectors. We
plan to expense these purchases with PA funds and the remaining grant
money.

### Project KITBUILD

None.

### Project SUPPLIES

Lack of new funds comming in is starting to become mildly worrisome.
This month's expenses include:

-   End mills.
-   Labeling tape.
-   Magenta ink.
-   PLA cartridges.

### Project EXPANSION

Considering a chop saw instead of a band saw. Still need to get research
done and validated.

### Project SPACECAM

## Member Reports

### mirage335

Have been extremely busy with tasks hoped to become profitable soon.

Photolithography fab has been scaled up even further to larger
high-resolution board. Plans, talent, and supplies have been mobilized
towards a simple, automatic PCB fab workstation, with throughput in the
range of about a dozen of boards per hour, with full multilayer
capability.

## Old Business

SEM work is in progress.

## New Business

Presidential Suggestion: We have specific projects which get stuff done
and we get recognition for. HARC is one such project. It's worth
spending a small amount of space to setup a permanent HARC table in the
classroom. We are not wasting space, we are spending it wisely on a
project that we value.

HARC agrees to not exceed the footprint of the desk that Lee has
procured. Vertical growth only, to the limit of 2' from the roof (as
required by Fire Marshal.)

## New Members

We voted in Ed O'Brien as a new member.
