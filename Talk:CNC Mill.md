## Config File

Should this section be deleted now? Some time prior to 03/26/12, the
mill seemed to start at 0,0,0, as described but that changed as of of
03/26/12. Now, EMC2 seems to know the mill's actual position (even if
the simulator is jogged with the mill turned off). Only "Touch Off"
really changes the coordinates.

## Page refactor for new software post-TJ refurb

I updated this page to reflect the fact that TJ reconfigured the mill
computer to WindowsXP and Mach3 (instead of Linux/EMC2/Axis) [Shawn Nock
