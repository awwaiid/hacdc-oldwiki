### Vice President's Report

### Secretary's Report

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### William Gibb

-   Still working with the resilient community folks. They are pretty
    busy but want to get their article on us done by this months end.
-   Working with a friend in Boston who is running a open-source
    alternative to MIT's design for empowerment course. It is a course
    focused on building communities like HacDC. The DFE eXtended course
    is hosted @ whichlight.com & will have 1-2 articles on HacDC this
    fall featured there.
-   Thinking of doing a workshop/learningshop on spectroscopy based off
    the materials mark Adams sent out yesterday.

#### Katie Bechtold

-   Planning an [LED Embroidery](LED_Embroidery) workshop and
    another tea night.
-   Literal door bell for HacDC?
-   Temporary tattoos - any interest evinced so far?
-   Willing to organize drafting of [Standing
    Rules](Standing_Rules) when that becomes sufficiently
    more important than becoming financially secure.
