## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project SUPPLIES - Mirage {#project_supplies___mirage}

An old receipt Bobby gave me has not been located. May have been
misplaced by me, or submitted and not yet reimbursed. Perhaps we should
just vote to reimburse Bobby from SUPPLIES as a general expense?

### Project EXPANSION - Mirage {#project_expansion___mirage}

Nothing to report.

### Project HAMRADIO - Jeff {#project_hamradio___jeff}

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM) - Julia {#project_electron_microscope_sem___julia}

### Project Optical Table Robot (OTR) - Julia {#project_optical_table_robot_otr___julia}

### Project CRISPR -Enrique {#project_crispr__enrique}

Made an interesting contact at USASEF, Capital Area BioSpace, a
burgeoning bio-space in DC currently with no physical space. We may hold
some event at HacDC in the future and discuss collaborations.

### Project SpaceBlimp -Enrique {#project_spaceblimp__enrique}

Had a booth at USASEF staffed mainly by volunteers and members of
Unallocated Space and Rockville RSC Makerspace. There's a prep meeting
tonight at Rockville RSC and probably another integration meeting on
Friday night as usual, as we're planning to launch Saturday morning.
Still deciding on important details like best launch location and
whether to pre-position recovery teams. The jet stream is pretty strong
last I checked so the track was very long and fast - hard for the launch
team to chase. Avi is also making progress on the website,
spaceblimp.org.

### Project Media Outreach - Matt {#project_media_outreach___matt}

### Project IT Infrastructure - Tom {#project_it_infrastructure___tom}

Still looking for problems to throw money at.
