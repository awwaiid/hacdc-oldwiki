# Article III: Expenditures and Reimbursements

Article III, as written here:
<http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php?title=Proposed_Standing_Rules&oldid=9449>
, was approved during the [Regular Member Meeting 2013 06
11](Regular_Member_Meeting_2013_06_11).

## Section 1: Process

### Preferred

Preferred way to purchase is by raising earmarked donations from
interested members

1.  Funds are donated to HacDC, earmarking them for specific purchase
    (by attaching note or emailing the Treasurer)
2.  HacDC Treasurer buys purchase using HacDC account
3.  This makes donations tax deductible, reduces paperwork, and makes
    group ownership of item clear
4.  HacDC may contribute some percentage of matching funds as finances
    permit

### Pre-Approval

With pre-approval by Board or membership vote, HacDC members may
purchase items with personal funds and get reimbursed by HacDC.

1.  Receipts must be saved and submitted to Treasurer in order to obtain
    reimbursement.
2.  Treasurer will issue check or electronic transfer

### Post-purchase Approval

If approval is not obtained in advance, reimbursement must be approved
by member vote - more than 2/3rds of a quorum of members must approve
expenditure

## Section 2: Approval

1.  Purchases required for the ongoing operation of HacDC (such as rent,
    insurance, licenses, and utilities) do not require authorization and
    shall be made at the Treasurer’s discretion.
2.  Purchases using earmarked funds donated for that purpose do not
    require approval as long as sufficient money has been contributed.
3.  Amounts under \$50 can be approved in advance by a unanimous vote of
    2/3rds or more of the Board of Directors.
    -   Expenditures that fail the BoD vote can still be approved by a
        membership vote
4.  Amounts over \$50 require a membership vote. More than 2/3 of a
    quorum of members must approve expenditure.
