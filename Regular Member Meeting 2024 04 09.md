May make a purchase proposal areas - prior to this our options have been
Discord or the dry erase.

Other options:

-   AirTable
-   Google Forms

Christopher will make a Google Form that will export into a spreadsheet

Callie is asking for a 3d printed casting setup. Liz recommends: Make a
furnace?

-   Collect cans to melt and recast
-   Can also be used on the CNC milling machine

Sven's community help ideas:

-   Recycle/remake scooter batteries - Side project?

## New Business {#new_business}

Policy in place for using dangerous equipment:

-   Possibly assign a person to each piece of equipment to approve
-   Restrict to members
    -   Restricting members for this meeting and requiring a release
        form, Obi will draft up a policy for approval and a release form
        for the future.

Make Open Project Night more visitor-friendly

-   Add some structure
-   Make sure people feel welcome, nametags, introducing ourselves
-   Make sure there are two people in the space (Going to be Christopher
    and Liz, Sven when possible)

Update Bylaws for Membership to clarify requirements for other
membership tiers

-   Qualifying Life Events that can cause monetary hardship.
-   Revisiting next month

The parking lot will be inaccessible sometime this year due to
construction in the neighboring lot (The church is unsure of dates,
should let us know when \`\`they\`\` are updated)

TLDR: Comcast pricing sucks - Gabriel reached out to check pricing, no
discounts for nonprofits, business line only. We will look into
[Astound](https://www.astound.com/business/smb/), highly recommended by
Chris and Kyle
