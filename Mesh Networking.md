# Brainstorming

## Official Project Page {#official_project_page}

[ Byzantium](Byzantium)

The notes below were used while formulating the project. Further notes
available on the now-Ongoing project page.

## Directions

Which way will we head with this?

-   support
    [Networking_Strategic_Simulation](Networking_Strategic_Simulation)
-   community wifi
-   cold hard maxout of the current tech
-   Development of communication devices with readily available (i.e.,
    cheap) technology.
-   Communication technology which lends itself to improvisational
    construction.

## What Next? {#what_next}

After we have our direction what are we gonna do?

-   define coverage
    -   building
    -   block
    -   neighborhood
    -   city
    -   intercity
    -   regional
    -   infinite (assuming it will grow with the technology's ability to
        support it)
-   audience - who's gonna use this
-   purpose - what will this be used for (surfing the web or just
    email/twitter/`<insert favorite text service here>`{=html})
-   Use case - circumstances under which this technology will usually be
    deployed
    -   ISP/ISP replacement
    -   disaster
    -   communication infrastructure failure
    -   censorship

## Aproaches

### Mesh

What will our approach to the network level of the mesh be?

-   broadcast
-   "actor" oriented - assume no knowledge in other nodes
-   nested - roll with what exists and use it to connect seperate
    traditional nets
-   Hybrid
    -   clients communicate using wifi with hubs
    -   hubs relay traffic using one of the mesh networking protocols
    -   IPv6 makes the addressing for this very sensible. address: \[1st
        half highest node "subnet"\]\[further refinement or
        subnets\]\[last block device id unique within the subnet\]

### Extension

If we need to augment our mesh to cover our target area how will we do
that?

-   "same stuff but on a larger physical scale"
    -   mesh nodes with more broadcast power
    -   some mesh nodes also have point-to-point links with each other
        -   tight-beam RF
        -   optical
            -   laser
            -   incoherent light
-   a higher order traditional network

## Crazy Ideas {#crazy_ideas}

-   viral node generation - present captive portals on carriers that
    require the user to become a "infected" and themselves present
    captive portals to other non infected devices (zombie smartphone
    apocalypse)
-   make it easy and fun for people to join
    -   mesh networking app in appstores
    -   add something fun to make them want to install the app, like a
        game or a visualization
    -   as long as they play once in a while, they route traffic
        (tamagochi effect)
-   one-stop shop router reflashing
    -   flash your Linksys WAP, automatically have mesh networking
        support active in the background
-   TonidoPlug?
-   datacomm over
    -   shortwave
        -   Note: requires more than two hams to participate
    -   FRS (been done before but would be an interesting experiment)
    -   GMRS (been done before but would be an interesting experiment)
    -   laser pointer with a photocell receiver
    -   incoherent light [Ronja](http://ronja.twibright.com/)
    -   Sneakernet with rsync-like functionality (project: mnemonic?)
    -   Slideshow
    -   One relatively large video screen
    -   One relatively decent webcam (not hard)
    -   Video screen displays sequences of 2D barcodes
    -   Computer with webcam reads and decodes barcodes
        -   Reminds me a bit of Conway's Game of Life as a network
            technology.
-   Fidomail-like transfer and synchronization of data bundles
    -   dialup
    -   tight-beam datacomm of some kind
    -   sneakernet (project: mnemonic?)
    -   Cross-technology implementation
        -   Web forums
        -   Microblogs
        -   Blogs
        -   BBS software
-   Automated sending and decoding of Morse code
    -   Might not be all that fast but would be easy to implement and
        fun to test the bandwidth of.
-   How could we abuse SMS for this?
-   Mobile nodes
    -   Someone sets up a (small) node in their car and drives around
        slowly.
    -   Set up in a backpack or under a coat
        -   On bicycle
        -   On rollerblades
        -   On skateboard
        -   ON UAV
        -   On a balloon
