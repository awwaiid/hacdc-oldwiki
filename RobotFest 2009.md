RobotFest 2009 is April 25, 2009 from 10 AM to 3 PM.

<http://www.robotfest.com/>

HacDC will have 2 tables where we will show off member projects and sell
Arduinos.

So we have an idea of what to plan for, please list any projects you'd
like to show off below. If you're not planning to be at RobotFest
yourself, you can put your projects on the RobotFest shelf in the space
(Please make sure someone who's going knows how to setup/use/display
your project). We'll take everything on the shelf with us and return it
to HacDC sometime on the evening of April 25.
