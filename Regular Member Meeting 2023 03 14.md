## Recognition

-   Gabe and Daniel for researching alternative Internet hosting
-   Karen for past donations

## New Members

-   Jared and Matthew M.
-   Jared's got a background in mechanical engineering. Along with
    Matthew M. wants to investigate the CNC mill. ([Mach
    3](https://www.machsupport.com/software/mach3/) is apparenty the
    standard software controller for CNC mills.) Lives close.
-   Matthew M. is a [Nix OS Linux](https://nixos.org/) fan (and the [Nix
    package manager in
    general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager))),
    hosting sesssions on its use at the space. Also does home
    automation, etc. Lives close.

## Old Business

-   The phone: Again a vote for an old-school hardwired landline.
    -   Brian suggests connecting to smart phones to create a phone tree
    -   Don says we used to have a phone for \$10.00 / year with a dial
        tone, but no one paid the bill and it appears to have gone away
    -   Gabe says people use Discord to request entry, if they know
        about it.
    -   Don will reach out this week to Jamie who will probably know
        about the phone.
    -   Michelle likes Discord for a bit of security over a buzzer: It's
        more likely people won't be strangers. But alternatives /
        backups worth consideration.

        use as well.
    -   (There's also an ancient, completely abandoned and mostly empty

    -   Sunday, April 23, 12:00 - 5:00

    -   Treasurer: **???** (Tristan put his name in the hat but may not
        be able to do it.)
        -   Matt will assist incoming treasurer, and says it's not too
            bad

            hiccups like bank mergers, church interactions, etc.)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Internet
    -   There was a hiccup that affected the church admin's Internet
    -   Regardless of the source, there was a meeting with Reverend
        Ronnie, and the decision was to become independent from the rest
        of the building and have our own server closet
    -   [Mobile Citizen](https://mobilecitizen.org/) - rather affordable
        at \$120/year
    -   Concerns about ham radio access from outside the space
    -   Plan to keep connected to the church's system while
        stress-testing the new system
    -   In-house experts seem to have solutions to potential glitches.
        Getting cooperation from a service provider can be tricky, when
        it comes to hosting servers that are accessible externally.
    -   Static IP difficult / impossible. Possibly use something like
        [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)
    -   An alternate hotspot provider but mobile citizen looks better
        [Calyx Institute](https://calyxinstitute.org/).
    -   Gabriel says: [CISPES](https://www.cispes.org/) is the other
        group at the church that pays for their own connection.
    -   Tentative testing: **APPROVED**

## Member Reports

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff)

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

-   Finances are healthy though they could use work:
    -   Bitcoin which was lost was found thanks to Tayeb
    -   COVID helped us on the rent and is still giving us a great deal
    -   The church accidentally paid our insurance for the year and
        needs to be reimbursed
    -   Not a lot of slack for unexpected minor catastrophes, let alone
        major ones.
    -   Need seven or eight more members in order to become more solidly
        stable and possibly grow the coffers.

### Secretary's Report

### Director-at-Large Reports
