### Secretary's Report

-   Dan Barlow de-membered himself. We will miss him.

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### William

Unable to attend due to school commitments.

Please use the website to publish things! We have one small posts up on
Spaceblimp 3; which briefly announced the planned date (which then
channged). We had no post to announce the rescheduled flight or too
announce the success of the flight. Is this a problem with people not
having access to the site or not willing to post things? If we are able
to aggressively use web + social media, it will build awareness of our
brand. This can potentially get us attention for funding from
organizations for projects (think for a Spaceblimp 4) once we get 501C3
status.

(Martin suggested that our website was tricky to use. Ben offered to
take stories and photos and post them up for people.)

Motley Fools used our space to hold their yearly software development
meeting. We netted a \$400 donation from that event. (Timball had an
emergency, owes Ben the Pyrate a dinner because Ben came in and covered
for him.)

#### Katie

-   Tea ceremony went very well. Around two dozen people attended.
    Scones and clotted cream.

## Member Reports

-   (Martin) Alberto and Martin have been working on a kickstarter
    proposal. Should we run a project or as a nebulous fill-out-the-shop
    request. We need to think about schwag. Alden donated some clocks,
    photos from near-space, APRS trackers for thousand-dollar donors,
    etc. We could also offer advertisements on future spaceblimp runs.
    Timball offered to help. Need to think about dollar amounts,
    strategy.

-   (Arc) Geeks night out has been doing well. Running PFSense for
    church router. QoS trouble. Getting data from church tenants to map
    them for IP admins.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   (Todd) Five went to Falls Church for FIRST robotics league mentoring
    meeting. Read up on FIRST if you don't know. Need for mentors in
    urban DC.

## Old Business

-   Proposal to limit discussion of official HacDC business with the
    church to the board. Motion passed.

## New Business

-   [ShmooCon Sleepover and
    Streaming](ShmooCon_Sleepover_and_Streaming) (Chris
    Koepke/Arc Riley) Motion passed.
