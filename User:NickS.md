### Current status {#current_status}

(As of 2015) Moved away to PA, reluctantly left HacDC.

### Archived page circa 2012 {#archived_page_circa_2012}

Hey, I'm Nick (the "nmapsy" email on blabber).

Became a member in October 2011 but I've been at the space regularly
since January (props to [Ben](User:Sitwon)'s
[TECS](TECS) class!).

**Update**: As of February I'm HacDC's Director-At-Large #2, in case
you're trying to track down Board members.

I'm a biologist, and at the moment I'm learning bioinformatics at Johns
Hopkins. There I've learned a fair amount of Perl and Java, and I'm
pretty comfortable on Unix.

Also, I'm [on Wikipedia](wikipedia:User:Qwerty0) a bit so I'm
a pretty capable MediaWiki editor. Oh, and another place I've been
involved is the [Archive Team](http://www.archiveteam.org). They do
awesome work saving user data from dead and dying sites. And they can
always use Unix hackers to help!

### Subpages

Convenient links for me: Subpages of my user page(usually drafts of
pages I'm working on).
