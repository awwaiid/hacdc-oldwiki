### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for June 2012:
![](HacDC_Financials_2012_06.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2012_06.pdf") Debits
from our rent checks have finally hit so our balance is back to normal.
We have four months' expenses in reserve not counting the money
earmarked for special projects.

Maybe it is the heat, but we had five non-paying members in June and
also lost two members (Scott Robbins and Daniel Ternes), while adding no
members. There are 2-5 other members who may be dropping in July so net
income will be reduced going forward until we pick up some new members.
Our expenses are running \$2750/mo which is 55 members, not counting the
generous additional donations we continue to receive from some members.
Adjusting for the rent payments we netted \~\$300 in June, which is
about what we are getting in additional member donations.

Quorum is 14 right now considering the two members who have already
dropped in July.

I met with our insurance agent and underwriter at the space. They
thought we were mis-characterized as an office-style non-profit in our
original policy. The underwriter said we sounded more like a community
educational group and there shouldn't be a problem getting a new policy,
but I haven't heard back with more details. They were very concerned
about woodworking and sawdust, which is a big fire risk.
