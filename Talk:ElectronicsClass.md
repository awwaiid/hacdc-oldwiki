hi! very excited about this class and looking forward to working
together! thought i would add some links to things i'm intrigued by and
hope to scratch the surface of eventually working with
interactive/sensor activated systems.

Hello

Im really excited about this class as well.

Im open to learning anything, but if there is a chance it would be great
to mess around with sensors, and then maybe sensor and micros.

looking forward to class tomorrow.

thanks
