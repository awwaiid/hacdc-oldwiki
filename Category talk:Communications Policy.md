irc channel should perhaps be mentioned on front page? --phf

Front page of the Wiki or front page of hacdc.org? Either way, it's a
good call. --[Nickfarr](User:Nickfarr) 15:05, 30 April 2008

i was thinking along the lines of "dynamic content" on the front page.
along with the email. this way people will know how to get in touch with
the team, without reading all the posts --phf

I agree too. So, who can make this update? -

## project mailing lists {#project_mailing_lists}

Right now the statement, "Each ongoing project must have an e-mail
address associated with it" isn't being enforced. Do we want to
reconsider that policy? Or start enforcing it?
