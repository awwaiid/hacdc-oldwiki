This is my proposal to amend the "MIBS Simplified Rules of Coordinated
Consensus through Chaos", our standing rules.

## Summary

-   Shift the burden of actual business and proposals to a once monthly
    meeting
-   Allow for informal, casual social gatherings on non-"monthly"
    meetings.
-   Improve the membership admission procedure

## Section I : Specific Types and Conduct of Meetings

### Standard Regular Meetings

Standard Regular Meetings are to be as informal as possible while
facilitating productive discussion on matters affecting the
organization.

The agenda of said meetings shall consist of Minister reports and items
suggested for discussion as arranged and agreed to by consensus of the
membership.

These meetings shall be informally guided by the Coordinator in Chief or
their designate. Meeting minutes shall be taken by the Keeper of the
MIBS or their designate and made available to all members for comment
and clarification. As such, all those attending have a responsibility to
produce accurate minutes of the meeting. Meeting minutes need not take
any particular format as long as the substance of the meeting discussion
is clear.

The only official items of business to be considered at a Standard
Regular meeting are:

-   Approval of the last Standard Regular Meeting's minutes
-   Admission of a new member.

Ministers shall be present at all Standard Regular Meetings and
available to receive feedback or entertain questions applicable to their
office. Ministers unable to attend shall submit an applicable written
report via any means available to the membership as a whole.

In the event quorum is not reached at a Standard Regular Meeting, the
duty to produce a report of what was discussed remains in effect on
those attending.

Standard Regular Meetings may take no longer than one hour if a member
scheduled event immediately follows.

### Formal Regular Meetings

Formal Regular Meetings shall take place monthly on dates decided at the
Annual Meeting.

Formal Regular Meetings shall be conducted under Roberts Rules of Order.
For purposes of those rules, the last Formal Meeting shall be considered
the prior meeting, though the discussions from Standard Regular Meetings
shall be admitted into the record.

Special meetings, as called per procedure in the Bylaws, shall be
considered a Formal Regular Meeting.

## Section II: Standing Rules

### Standing Rule 1 : Admission of Members

For the purposes of Article II, Section 3, any eligible person present
at any meeting, provided a quorum is present, may present themselves for
election as a member. It is duty of any member present to nominate
present member candidates.

Upon visual approval of the member candidate, they shall be considered a
member as soon as their first periodic dues have been paid or waiver
granted. If admitting the member would break quorum, they shall be
considered a member at the close of the meeting.

The Minister of Finance may grant any member privilege, except the right
to vote at a meeting, to any member candidate, provided that
notification of privileges granted is given electronically to all
members and posted in a conspicuous place in the registered office.

The Minister of Finance and Keeper of the MIBS will coordinate to ensure
all member privileges have been conveyed to all newly admitted members.
They shall jointly issue a report on the current membership count prior
to every meeting.

### Standing Rule 2 : Special Meetings at other times

To accommodate the needs of the members as well as any potential
pressing issues, the Ministers shall occasionally schedule Special
Meetings in accordance with Article III, Section 3, at times other than
the regularly scheduled time.

For the purposes of Article III, Section 3, "Special Meetings", a
petition may be considered signed if any member electronically conveys
their approval for such a proposed meeting to all other members through
a means established by the Ministers.

### Standing Rule 3 : Annual Meeting Business not determined at the Annual Meeting

For the purposes of Article III, Section 2, "Annual Meetings", if any
required business is not conclusively determined by resolution at the
Annual Meeting, said business must be entertained as the first orders of
business at the next regularly scheduled Formal Regular Meeting
