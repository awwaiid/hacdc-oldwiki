I *really* don't want to bureaucratize this, but how has it been decided
what subset of our inventory is for sale? -

## We don't need hookup wire!

TC, you might not have noticed that, on my last visit, I brought down
two sizable hanks of telco wire. One bunch is 24AWG, one bunch is 22AWG.
It's all multipair, twisted to cat-3 spec (so it's easy to untwist),
tinned copper, with color-coded jackets following the modern telco
scheme. I think there's around a dozen feet of each, which multiplied by
the number of pairs in the jacket, works out to many hundreds of feet of
wire. The bulk of it is stored on the floor in a heavy triwall
corrugated box labeled "WIRE", and there are some smaller bits pulled
out of the outer jacket, sitting in the small plastic shoebox behind the
door, also labeled "WIRE". Check it out!
