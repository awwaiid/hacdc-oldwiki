Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for December 2014:
![](HacDC_Financials_2014_12.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2014_12.pdf"). We
gained Gary Sparkes (Hunter) as a new member, re-gained Ann Millspaugh
as a returning member, and lost Christine Prefontaine and Phillip
Walker. We have 44 dues-paying members in good standing and 6
dues-waived members.

The CFC charity application is proving non-trivial to complete. By
January 23 we must, in addition to the forms completed thus far:

-   submit supporting statements and/or documentation of substantial
    local presence in the geographical area covered by the local
    campaign and a description of the programs, services, benefits, etc.
    provided by the organization in calendar year 2014 and how those
    programs, services, benefits, etc. affect human health and welfare
    of the target population.
-   complete and submit a Pro Forma [IRS Form
    990](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990.pdf). The following
    sections must be completed: Page 1, Items A-M; Part I (Summary and
    Part II, Signature Block), Lines 1-4 only; Part VII (Compensation
    section A only); Part VIII (Statement of Revenues); Part IX
    (Statement of Functional Expenses), and; Part XII (Financial
    Statements and Reporting).
-   prohibit the sale or lease of CFC contributor lists

#### Project Awesome {#project_awesome}

Here is the Project Awesome spreadsheet for December:
![](HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_12.pdf "HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_12.pdf"). We
continue to have to dip into savings to pay our rent, so no dividend
this month. :(

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

No Report.

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}

#### Travis

CNC will be running by end of the month. Prusa is running.

#### Zack

No report.

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project LASER {#project_laser}

No report. Hand-off required?

### Project BYZANTIUM {#project_byzantium}

We're re-factoring the project. Slowly because we all have jobs now.

### Project KITBUILD {#project_kitbuild}

Nothing new to report. Still hoping to organize a kit build in concert
with a Learn to Solder event sometime this spring.

### Project SUPPLIES {#project_supplies}

Ordered replacement extruder for Rostock Max. Also ordered 0.35mm nozzle
for dramatically improved resolution.

When finances become less strained, a Rev.7 PCB heater would be a nice
addition. More even heating across the glass would reduce thermal stress
and greatly improve adhesion.

### Project EXPANSION {#project_expansion}

Still conservative.

### Project HAMRADIO {#project_hamradio}

Don has installed a 2 element 10m and a 160m dipole antenna. Don fitted
a narrow (CW) filter in the main HF radio to improve narrow signal
performance. We have participated in a number of on-air contests and
contacted more than 100 countries.

#### Lessons from Kamal Jain of Lowell Makes {#lessons_from_kamal_jain_of_lowell_makes}

Met Kamal Jain from [http://lowellmakes.com/ Lowell
Makes](http://lowellmakes.com/_Lowell_Makes), Massachusetts
hackerspace last month. Among other things, we discussed revenue/sponsor
structures. Recently received email detailing these opportunities. In
particular, we should look into
<https://doublethedonation.com/blog/2014/08/donation-requests/>.

#### Shimmer

HacDC server Shimmer is proving stable. Please contact me by email
(directly or members@hacdc.org) for an account.

#### RFID

NetPLC boards and parts are in, so RFID system will be implemented soon.

## Old Business {#old_business}

## New Business {#new_business}

### Cams

Funding and installation of 'lights-on' cameras, and authorize BoD to
examine other relevant footage (ie. hallway cams) to correlate
incidents. Members' identities would not be recorded in any way not
already documented (ie. hallway cam).

This proposal is not a plan of action (ie. we may not need to buy cams),
just a provision for future improvement.

Approved the installation of camera. Funding and technical details to be
revisited.

### Dues Structure {#dues_structure}

We may benefit from some sort of multi-level membership structure,
perhaps particularly to ensure fair compensation for renting the office
space.

Needs to be discussed and revisited in a separate meeting.

### Increase Dues by \$10 for one year {#increase_dues_by_10_for_one_year}

Approved.
