## Step-by-Step {#step_by_step}

1.  Pick a kit that people are interested in.
    -   Check out [Kit Building](Kit_Building) for some
        ideas.
    -   If you're uncertain, poll some of your friends or post to the
        blabber list.
    -   If you haven't built this kit before, now would be a good time
        to order one and **try it out**.
2.  Price out the kit, including shipping and payment processing
    (usually around \$1-1.50) costs. It's best if everyone can walk out
    with a working gadget for less than \$30 total. Note what tools are
    needed. HacDC may already have what's needed.
    -   Spare parts?
    -   Batteries?
3.  Pick a date and time.
    -   Weekend afternoons are nice because people aren't under pressure
        to rush from work or get home.
    -   Try to pick a date 4-6 weeks in the future.
4.  Create a page for your event, including registration.
    -   [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) is a classic option. To
        account for transaction fees, enter your ticket price based on
        the following formula (assumes PayPal): (final_price + 0.32871)
        / 0.970275 . The easy route:

    1.  [Create an EventBrite account](http://www.eventbrite.com/signup)
    2.  Setup a payment option
        -   Use Eventbrite itself. They will mail a check to you 5 days
            after your event
        -   Use PayPal - About as fast as it gets. Transfer to bank
            account takes about 3 days, no need to wait until reg closes
            even
            1.  [Create a PayPal
                account](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_registration-run)
            2.  [Add your PayPal address to
                EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/payment-information)
        -   [Google Checkout](https://checkout.google.com/sell) requires
            that you have a products page, not a good fit. Fees
            comparable to PayPal
        -   Check, pay at the door, and invoice payments will be handled
            by you
    3.  [Create your event](http://www.eventbrite.com/create)

    -   [The main HacDC site](http://hacdc.org) is equipped with
        [CiviCRM](http://civicrm.org/). You can [use the
        template](http://hacdc.org/civicrm/event/add&reset=1&action=add&template_id=6)
        to speed things up, but make sure you check the various
        settings.
    -   If you want to avoid fronting money that you may or may not get
        back, have registration close with enough lead time for you to
        order the materials.
    -   Ask people to bring needed tools if they have them. Even if
        HacDC has some, it may not have enough to go around.
5.  Follow other steps on [How to Run an
    Event](How_to_Run_an_Event)
6.  Print directions for everyone. Some ways to save paper:
    -   Ask people to share
    -   Use the projector in the space as a supplement. Don't rely on
        people "staying together", though.
    -   Print on both sides of the paper
    -   Shorten existing directions in some way, or write your own

## Additional Pitfalls {#additional_pitfalls}

-   Don't trust things to work. **Test** it all in advance. That
    includes:
    -   Parts lists
    -   Firmware
    -   Directions
    -   Seriously, **check it all**
