### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

All four Purple Martins fleged. Probably headed to South America by now,
if not there already. [Photos

Good luck!

Personally constructing Taz_Mega, combining features from both
FlexReplicator and LulzBot Taz designs. Existing Taz machines can be
upgraded with compatible custom metal plates. Progress documented at
[Aleph Objects'
forum](https://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2559&start=20).

#### Alternative Office Space {#alternative_office_space}

Recommend we do not take the office space down the hall. We would be
better off retaining one of the existing spaces, with access to
plumbing.

Part-time subletting of the classroom space may also be possible.

#### Furniture

Workroom furniture is not 100% efficient, and the middle area is not a
great classroom space. Yet, the classroom seems just fine with 3' of
desks along the long walls. Suggest we build permanent tables, shelves,
and tool enclosures along the classroom walls. Done right, this could
vastly improve usability of the space for hardware work, while occupying
little of the classroom space.

This can be done one workstation at a time, gradually moving equipment
and freeing up space. CAD models should be available soon.

#### IT Admin {#it_admin}

HacDC servers suffered some downtime, due to external power failure
exceeding UPS capabilities. Shell/VPS servers Starlight/Shimmer are
fully operational at present, haxwithaxe's NAS server is temporarily
offline. Modern desktops/laptop hardware is currently in short supply,
owing to some failures over the years. Please let others know if you can
spare some replacement hardware.

A ToDo/Wishlist category has been added to the wiki. The old wishlist
page was perpetually obsolete, hopefully a category page linked to user
pages, projects, etc, will be easier to maintain.

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

Income from memberships for August: \$1500 Donations: \$150

paypal balance: \$1341.66 Dwolla balance: \$890 bank balance: \$6853.39

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

Not much to report; mostly the proposals. We generally need more
members. 32 members, a third of which aren't really active, is not
enongh. HacDC doesn't really work without active members teaching
classes and helping out. We're becoming overreliant on Juri for 3D
Thursdays, Web Scraping, Treasurer, etc.

### Project LASER {#project_laser}

### Project KITBUILD {#project_kitbuild}

### Project SUPPLIES {#project_supplies}

Four Raspberry Pi's have been purchased, to be expensed soon. At least
two are immediately planned for dedication to HacDC 3D printers.

Planning further repairs and upgrades, likely including the following.

-   Repair/buy more desktops/laptops as needed.
-   Hard disks may be needed, either for NAS capacity upgrades, or RAID
    redundancy.

### Project EXPANSION {#project_expansion}

No expenditures this month.

We could upgrade to this outstanding mitre saw someday:
<http://www.sears.com/craftsman-10inch-compound-miter-saw-21236/p-00921236000P?sid=IDx01192011x000001&pla&kpid=00921236000&kispla=00921236000P&kpid=00921236000&mktRedirect=y>
.

Lumber may be needed for custom furniture in the classroom. Funding this
through EXPANSION is a possibility.

### Project HAMRADIO {#project_hamradio}

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

## Old Business {#old_business}

-   Pending: Proposal for a list of special tool custodians and list of
    authorized users (eg CNC, Laser Cutter, Lathe, etc).
-   Pending: CryptoParty 2015?

## New Business {#new_business}

Proposal 1a: HacDC may sublet the classroom to other corporations during
the hours of 7am to 5:30pm, Monday thru Friday. HacDC authorizes the
board of directors to negotiate the terms of such a sublet for periods
not exceeding one year. (Paying rent for the classroom M-F 9-5 and
keeping it empty is extremely rent-inefficient. This is Plan A.)
Proposal was **APPROVED by 7-0 vote.**

Proposal 1b: See 1a but restrict to non-profit organizations. (We
probably need all options open right now though.) This proposal was not
voted on.

Proposal 2a: Negotiate a change to our lease agreement with St.
Stephen's to exclude the workshop and lower our rent accordingly as soon
as possible. Consolidate the workshop into the current classroom and
basement. Authorize the board to negotiate the change to our lease and
lower rent amount. (This is clearly Plan B or C.) Proposal was
**APPROVED by 6-0 vote.**

Proposal 3a: HacDC may display sponsorship information on our home page
(in addition to the sponsors page) and have a display of current
sponsors at all public events. The board shall be authorized to
negotiate terms of sponsorship for periods not exceeding 1 year.
Proposal was **APPROVED by 7-1 vote**

Proposal 3b: Same as 3a but restrict 3a to organizations that provide
technical, educational or artistic products and services. (Again, 3a
would give us more freedom and options right now.) This proposal was not
voted on.

Proposal 4a: Approve expenditure of \$200 from the general fund towards
the purchase of HacDC-branded tee shirts. (Design TBD) (An easy way to
advertise HacDC at HacDC public events, we could also give them away to
guests for more advertising.) Proposal was **APPROVED by 8-to-0.**

Proposal 5a: Approve creation of a billboard up to 36x48" for the
display of HacDC sponsors' logos up to 12x12" each at HacDC events.
Authorize the board to negotiate sponsorship prices for a period of one
year. Proposal was **APPROVED by 8-to-0.**

Proposal 6 (see email 8/31): We have an offer from St. Stephen's to move
to HacDC's original room at St. Stephen's, recently vacated by One World
Education, for rent of \$940/mo. This would nominally put us at a budget
surplus immediately. The room is 400sqft, the same as our current
classroom. It includes a sink and dedicated restroom (currently not
working) and window A/C units rather than central air. We'd keep the
basement. This offer is reserved for HacDC until Thursday 9/10/2015.
Proposal **APPROVED by 5-to-4.**

Upon further discussion there was general sense that the 3D Printing and
HARC station would stay in the upstairs classroom, the woodworking,
metalworking and laser cutter would move to the basement.
