Some members of HacDC wonder if Mark actually exists. Although his crazy
schedule makes it appear that he is merely a semi-intelligent AI SpamBot
firing emails at the HacDC list, he does in fact exist
^\[citation\ needed\]^. His primary interests are computer simulation,
nanotechology, autonomous cooperative robotics and electronics. He would
love to be a better skateboarder, which is mostly incompatible with
wearing a suit all the time...
