When considering the health impacts of
[Roundup](http://www.productliabilitywiki.com), the world’s most popular
herbicide, one might believe that only those who come into direct
contact with it are in danger.

A German study focused on increased botulism cases in cattle – caused by
glyphosate. The researchers found that chronic, or ongoing, exposure to
glyphosate at residual levels, was interfering with the cattle’s
digestive system, leading to botulism outbreaks. The study found that
cattle could have been exposed to glyphosate not only environmentally
but also through cattle feed.

Attorney [Lisa G. Douglas](http://www.lisagdouglas.com/) of North Little
Rock noted that many people who don’t use Roundup are at danger because
of the herbicide.
