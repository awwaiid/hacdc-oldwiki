## Incoming Suggestions {#incoming_suggestions}

add DPL
:   Dynamic Page Listing enables the creation of, well, dynamic search
    results within a page. For example a list of the last 5 monthly
    meeting pages that updates on refreshing the page. DPL has many uses
    and can play a key role in moving toward a semantic wiki. You can
    create standard tables (forms) and pull the contents willy-nilly.
    It's useful and fun for the whole family! ...well, except for Bob,
    but he's just a grump.

Adding DPL will require a **server admin**.

Examine User Defaults - Dec2013
:   Mediawiki installs with a very conservative set of defaults for user
    preferences. Most users will never (speaking from experience) bother
    to change them. I'd like to suggest turning on 'add page to
    watchlist' for all edited pages, and email user when notifications
    are triggered. There are others I'll return later with a list.
    -   ON - E-mail me when my user talk page is changed

    :   Leave at least one path open that other editors can contact a
        user.

    -   ON - Enable section editing via \[edit\] links

    :   On busy pages, reduces editing conflicts.

    -   ON - Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary

    :   Summaries are a major help to heavy users and often alleviate
        misunderstanding for all users. This will encourage their use.

    -   ON - Add pages I edit/move/create to my watchlist

    :   A must, pretty much a cornerstone of collaboration.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

CSS - whitespace
:   add `whitespace:pre-wrap;` to the CSS, perhaps under *p*.
:   This will alleviate the problem in the editing layout where users
    have to add additional empty lines in order to control spacing.

    for changes.

CSS - tweak headers
:   In a long, long standing tradition the default CSS on Mediawiki has
    a peculiar take on header formatting. H4 all but disappears in the
    text, H3 is bolded while H2 is not. It's just weird I tell ya'. I'm
    not graphic designer, but maybe bolding them all would be more
    clear. ...and maybe decreasing the line spacing between the header
    and its text...?? (yes you can laugh at my OCD)

```{=html}
<div style="border:1px solid black; width:600px; padding:1em; margin-left:2em;">
```
## Header 2 {#header_2}

some text

### Header 3 {#header_3}

some more text

#### Header 4 {#header_4}

yep, even more text

```{=html}
</div>
```
-   I bolded h2 - [Gatohaus](User:Gatohaus) 02:18, 1 December
    2010 (UTC). Change made in
    [MediaWiki:Common.css](MediaWiki:Common.css).

:   The headers could use more help but maybe this'll do...?
