This page was started by [User:Katie](User:Katie) after [the
LED Cuff
workshop](http://hacdc.org/content/soft-circuits-led-cuff-workshop) to
record her thoughts about potential improvements, but anyone is welcome
to contribute to it.

## General Lessons Learned. {#general_lessons_learned.}

These tips apply to any workshop held at HacDC or a similar hackerspace.

-   If attendees need to register, make it more than obvious that they
    do.
-   Limit participation to about a dozen people so as not to overcrowd
    the space. Hold multiple sessions if needed to accommodate people.
-   Bring extra materials and tools -- participants will lose track of
    things, especially small things, or want to start over with a fresh
    whatever-it-is.
-   Signs posted in the building directing people to HacDC are a good
    thing.
-   Only give kits to folks who registered.
    -   Was there anyone who registered and showed up who didn't receive
        a kit? I thought I had struck a good compromise between fairness
        and efficiency by giving no-shows' kits to walk-in participants
        a little while after the workshop started. -

## LED Cuff-specific Lessons Learned

These tips apply specifically to the LED Cuff workshop.

-   The
    [instructions](http://www.sparklab.la/bracelet/tutorial_wearablelight.pdf)
    could use a good diagram of the layout of everything in and on the
    cuff.
-   Ditch the velcro, which is too hard to sew by hand, in favor of
    snaps or something like that.
-   Bring a seam ripper for fixing mistakes.
-   A standard hole punch will jam and possibly break when you use it to
    abuse leather or other leather-like material.
-   [These LEDs](http://www.lc-led.com/View/itemNumber/129) may be
    cheaper.
    -   For the workshop we got the LEDs for \$.65 each through Digikey.
        Looks like the ones above are actually more expensive. -

-   Turning the legs of the battery holder out away from the center of
    the holder seemed to hold them to the fabric better than turning
    them in. Cutting off the plastic posts on the bottom of the battery
    holder kept it closer to the fabric. These
    [sewable](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8822)
    battery holders may have been more expensive but easier for this
    project.
