[hackerspaces:Notacon](hackerspaces:Notacon)

-   We will show up, we will bring soldering irons, we will network with
    other hacker spaces, and we WILL win ABE. (Even though Nate is, as
    the project coordinator, technically disqualified from helping us
    build our craft the GREATEST entry in the history of ABE.)

### [Rooftop Garden](Rooftop_Garden)? {#rooftop_garden}

-   "I also think it would be interesting to talk to the church about
    using the roof as a community garden, and having a vermiculture
    fertilizer source on site would be terrific."
    -   I've discussed this with the church in the past. Apparently, the
        roof is not structurally sound enough to support a garden, but I
        believe we can gain support for building the requisite supports.
        It's a project worth keeping on the back
        burner.--[63.250.141.186](Special:Contributions/63.250.141.186)
