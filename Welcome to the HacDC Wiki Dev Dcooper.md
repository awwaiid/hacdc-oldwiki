to HacDC. `</span>`{=html}

We are a hacker space located in Washington, DC. HacDC members improve
the world by creatively rethinking technology. We break, build, and
occasionally abuse technology in the pursuit of greater knowledge about
how it works and repurposing it to build new things. Our shop is located
in the
\[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Heights%2C_Washington%2C_D.C>.
Columbia Heights\] neighborhood of DC.

If you're new here, you should start by looking at our public web site
at [hacdc.org](http://www.hacdc.org/). Our Wiki is mostly for internal
organization, but you're welcome to look through to get a sense of what
we work on (and consider joining yourself!).
