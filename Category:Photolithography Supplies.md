# Premanufactured

These materials work well...

## Substrate

-   [Variety of presensitized copper clad board from
    mouser.](http://www.mouser.com/Tools-Supplies/Prototyping-Products/Copper-Clad-Boards/_/N-b11ou?P=1yzsoajZ1yzvq68)
    [Datasheet.](http://www.alliedelec.com/images/products/datasheets/bm/MG_CHEMICALS/70125847.pdf)
    Specifically recommend 590-660 .

## Developer Chemicals

-   [Positive Developer Chemical - Compatible with above presensitized
    copper clad
    board.](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/MG-Chemicals/418-500ML/?qs=X5SXQx2ktnP2R5Pl77QFKw%3d%3d)

# Raw

Starting from raw materials may be cheaper and doable, but has yet to be
thoroughly tested.

## Substrate

-   [5 x 8 Scissor Cut Ultra Thin Copper Clad - Cheap for
    Photolithographic PCB
    Fab](http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=G17455)
-   [10x 6x8" Photosensitive Dry Film
    Sheets](http://www.amazon.com/Negative-Film-Photoresist-Sheets-Prototype/dp/B00B0Z8AZ6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1387391738&sr=8-3&keywords=photosensitive+dry+film)

## Developer Chemicals

-   [Sodium Carbonate Washing Soda. May not be suitable for processing
    positive
    resists.](http://www.amazon.com/Church-03020-Arm-Hammer-Washing/dp/B0029XNTEU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387395481&sr=8-1&keywords=washing+soda)

Positive developer chemicals apparently use a Sodium Hydroxide and
Sodium Silicate mixture. This may reliably permit deep development
without overdependent of unexposed regions.
