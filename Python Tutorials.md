From the HacDC Blabber list: Does anyone know of a good tutorial on GUI
programming for complete idiots in Python?

(Keven) These might offer a reasonable starting point:

-   [Rapid Application Development with Python and
    Glade](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7421)
-   [A Beginner's Guide to Using pyGTK and
    Glade](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6586)
-   [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/)
-   [Glade](http://glade.gnome.org/)

Other resources of a more general nature (and of varying levels of
idiocy):

-   [Official, but occasionally technical
    documentation](http://docs.python.org/)
-   [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/)
-   [Snake Wrangling for
    Kids](http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/writing/snake-wrangling-for-kids/)
-   [Python for Fun](http://www.openbookproject.net/py4fun/)
-   [PyBiblio](http://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/)
-   [How to Think Like a Computer
    Scientist](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/)
-   [A Byte of Python](http://ibiblio.org/g2swap/byteofpython/read)
-   [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.org/)
-   [QT from TrollTech](http://trolltech.com/)

(Riley) However by far the best resource I used was:

-   [Creating a GUI using PyGTK and
    Glade](http://www.learningpython.com/2006/05/07/creating-a-gui-using-pygtk-and-glade/)

(Mark) Being able to open a file dialog is a key part of many GUI
program. Here is a good approach:
<http://code.activestate.com/recipes/438123/> And here is a [progress
bar](https://web.archive.org/web/20161129001536/http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/ProgressBar).

Between those two things, I have made many GUIs that are in front of
analytical software tools that I have implemented in Python originally
as command-line utilities.

The easiest place to start is the "simplest possible tkinter program"
here:
<http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/the_simplest_possible_Tkinter_program>

Then go through the list of widgets at [A tour of Tkinter
widgets](https://web.archive.org/web/20170502214437/http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/A_tour_of_Tkinter_widgets).
Grab the right version for your python installation (2.x or 3.x) and
unpack it. Run it and you can click the "see code" button for any
element. It is a great earning tool, especially since it is all running
in Python on your computer, too!
