Important documents relating to HacDC corporate or non-profit status,
and HacDC policies and procedures.

:   **Form 1023 Draft** -working doc from our initial filing
:   **Articles of Incorporation** -HacDC's initial filing for becoming a
    501(c)(3).
:   **Bylaws** - the core rules, basically defining everything, meant to
    change little over time
:   **Standing Rules** - the details, meant to be modified as needed
:   **Policies** - rules or expectations of those working with HacDC (if
    the policy is adopted)

Confusion between what should be a by-law and what should be a standing
rule is common in many organizations. We'll try not to worry about it
too much.

As of May 2013, some of these policies have not been adopted. TODO
