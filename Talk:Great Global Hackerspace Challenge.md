## First Email - From Mark @ Agent Silverfox --[Redbeard](User:Redbeard) 01:45, 22 March 2011 (UTC) {#first_email___from_mark_agent_silverfox___redbeard_0145_22_march_2011_utc}

Hi there,

I'm emailing you on behalf of Mitch Altman and the Great Global
Hackerspace Challenge that you're participating in. My name is Mark and
I work for Silverfox. We're based in San Francisco, California. We're
running this competition for our client element14.

(If this email has been received at a general mailbox for your
Hackerspace and you're not familiar with this program please reply and I
can let you know who at your space you can direct this to.)

Our team includes Claire, Sally and Ryan and we'll be available through
out this project to help with scheduling, finances, travel and
publishing. We want to get a group phone or Skype call set up to
introduce ourselves and answer any questions you may have. Since we
would like to have you set up on the element14.com community by Friday
March 25th we'd like to get a call planned as soon as possible to
provide as much assistance as we can.

Would you be free tomorrow Tuesday March 22nd or Wednesday March 23rd
for 30-60 minutes? Here is a link to a free scheduling service where you
can let us know which times are good for you.

Click on as many of the suggested slots that you could attend and we'll
pick a time that hopefully works for everyone.

If you're not available for voice calls we want to be flexible. Let us
know how you'd like to communicate - Basecamp, email, IM. It's all good
with us. We will also be communicating with you directly for private
discussions.

We're looking forward to meeting you all!
