Hard work is one way to gain an impressive number of followers on
Instagram. But there’s another way: Just [Buy Instagram
Followers](http://fansdesk.info/buy-instagram-followers/).

That’s what Dan Nainan did in 2012.

The veteran New York comic, who performed last year at a corporate event
in Overland Park, had loyal fans and more than a million views on
YouTube. But he had only 700 Instagram followers, not much for someone
who had performed for President Barack Obama and billionaire Donald
Trump.

So he bought 400,000 more for \$424.

“I have a friend who told me he has 10,000 followers,” Nainan said.
“Took him two years working two hours a day. I’m thinking, why on earth
would I waste that much time on something so ephemeral?”

While some comedians and social media experts have criticized him,
Nainan says his juiced-up Instagram following has helped him book more
shows, gain more fans and get more respect.

“It’s a perception-is-reality thing,” he said. “It’s like, ‘Oh, this guy
has this many followers? He must be amazing.’”

Celebrities, politicians, businesses and reality show contestants are
suspected of buying blocs of Instagram followers to appear more
prestigious or popular. What you waiting for ? Go check
