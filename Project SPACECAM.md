This is the project page for webcams in HacDC.

## Current Proposals

-   Option 1

Linux platform + usb a/v + room projector (1024x768) + polycom
soundstation. Chrome + Google Hangouts + Google Voice + Youtube + VNC +
Webcamstudio for a/v (PIP, desktop as video source, etc). -- either two
linux machines for two instances of Presenter@hacdc in Hangouts, or one
and another Linux VM (for the projector) but both using Webcamstudio and
VNC.

-   Option 2

Linux platform + usb a/v + room projector (1024x768) + polycom
soundstation. Jitsi WebRTC Videobridge (meet.jit.si service) + Chrome +
Ustream + VNC + Webcamstudio for a/v (PIP, desktop as video source,
etc). -- either two linux machines for two instances of Presenter@hacdc
in Jitsi, or one and another Linux VM (for the projector) but both using
Webcamstudio and VNC.

## Tested Platforms

### Google Hangouts

Good

-   Crossplatform
-   Public Youtube stream (20 sec delay)
-   Dial-in number?

Bad

-   CPU intensive

### Jitsi

Good

-   Crossplatform (Chrome)

Bad

-   BW intensive (peered connections, no mixing)

### Web RTC

Good

-   Crossplatform (Chrome)
-   Less CPU intensive

Bad

-   No chat or screenshare
-   BW intensive (peered connections, no mixing)

All platforms tested with dual core 1.8ghz and 2-3 users, on HacDC clear
wireless and Verizon 4g LTE

## Posting Links

people who host the hangout for events should post the link to the
hangout as many places as they see fit just so long as it isn't a public
hangout (as in don't share to +Public) on g+ the random trolls will have
sufficient delay finding the link so it shouldn't be an issue. for the
member meetings i would suggest we consistently post a link in 3 places
(we can potentially automate this):

-   the meeting minutes
-   irc
-   the members list

if we have an on the air view only stream we should also post that link
to blabber as our meetings are intended to be public.
