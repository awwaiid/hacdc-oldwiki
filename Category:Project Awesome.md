**Project Awesome** is a way for HacDC members to fund projects and
increase the awesomeness of the space. Any members can propose a
project, and each member can vote on the projects they want to support.
Each month, any funds beyond our expenses get divided among the active
projects according to the member votes. Here is the [full
proposal](Project_Awesome_Rules) (approved by the members at
the [11 Sept 2012
meeting](Regular_Member_Meeting_2012_09_11)).

### Voting for Projects

Each HacDC member gets one vote which can be divided among the active
projects as desired. To vote, send an email to awesome@hacdc.org with
instructions on how you would like your vote divided (e.g. "100% to
PROJECT_A" or "50% each to PROJECT_B and PROJECT_C".) Your vote will
stay in force until changed.

### Supporting Projects

If you would like to support one of the Project Awesome projects with an
additional donation, just send funds to HacDC (using PayPal, Dwolla, or
a paper check) and include the project code as a comment. The money will
be earmarked for use in the project you have selected!

### Project List

Members of HacDC can vote to support one of these projects by sending an
email with the project code to 'awesome@hacdc.org'.
