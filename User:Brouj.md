Roofing contractors should have full, reliable credentials. Nearly every
state makes licensing a requirement, so be sure that they have the
proper licensing. In addition, contractors should have full liability
insurance in case they have an accident at your home. That way, you will
not be liable.

Sometimes a contractor with his own workers can be more cost effective
than a contractor who has no workers. More workers means the job will be
completed quicker, which means lower costs. If you have a contractor
doing it alone, make sure that they aren't inflating the labor costs
because of it.

The age of the roof can determine if it needs to be replaced. Most roofs
need to be replaced about every 20 years. When your current roof is a
second layer on top of your old roof, it has to be replaced after 20
years.[شركات عزل
