This project was launched with a sprint on Feb 25-27, 2011. Sprints will
be held the last weekend of every month.

## Project Goals

The goal of Project Byzantium is to develop a communication system by
which users can connect to each other and share information in the
absence of convenient access to the Internet.

The use cases for such a system would be:

1.  The infrastructure for accessing the internet has become damaged or
    inaccessible. (Eg, a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina.)
2.  A central authority has decided to explicitly block or shutdown key
    infrastructure. (Eg, Egypt's recent internet blackout.)
3.  A zombie apocalypse in which the personnel responsible for
    maintaining key infrastructure have all been turned.

The project aims to develop and publish the necessary documentation,
best practices, and software to construct and support such a system. Our
current approach is to start by investigating and documenting the
existing technologies which would support such a system. In particular,
mesh networking protocols, wireless networking technologies, and
decentralized (or less-centralized) alternatives to internet
addressing/naming systems such as DNS. In designing the system, we aim
to reduce the dependency on exotic hardware or skill sets so that the
system can be deployed quickly and easily by average internet users.

An additional goal is that users not actively participating in the mesh
network (i.e., not running mesh routing software on their devices) can
make use of the network without having to install anything new,
jailbreak their phone, or pry the information out of a hacker infected
with the Exsurgent virus.
