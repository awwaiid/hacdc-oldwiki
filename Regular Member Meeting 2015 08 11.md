## Director Reports

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

Biohacking. Saved four Purple Martin hatchlings, stapling wire mesh
around their nest as a much needed mechanical support. All four have
since reached near adult-size, likely headed to South America soon. \<3

Broken Taz3 3D printer, again, largely due to PEI delamination. Complete
story, existing upgrades, and planned upgrades posted at the [LulzBot
Forums](https://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2454).

Last month has been busy. Still hoping to spend a couple weeks fixing
things up at HacDC soon.

### Treasurer's Report

### Secretary's Report

-   Half a dozen people have signed up and paid the \$25 ticket for the
    upcoming TOOOL lockpicking class, Sept 12th.
-   I haven't had time to write up a proposal for charging for classes
    and splitting the proceeds.
-   I didn't sort the Outgoing so nothing is getting trashed this month.
-   St. Stephen's renovations are tying up the auditorium every
    Saturday, all day and crowding the schedule for the dining room as
    well. As a result we're pretty restricted as far as dates to hold
    large events like the Cryptoparty. As Pat points out, there are
    other nearby locations (eg other churches) with suitable spaces for
    large events. We should reach out to them about availability.

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### Don

(by Enrique)

-   Have accepted a donation of an amateur radio repeater currently at
    another location with an antenna. The allocated frequency didn't
    come with the donation, so the repeater is not operational.
    Acquiring a new repeater frequency allocation might take years, so
    HARC has some decisions to make about this equipment.
-   Did two Learn to Solder classes. More pending scheduling openings.
-   Going to the Foundation Center for a video storytelling workshop
    tomorrow.
-   Want to schedule a day to set up a HacDC show-n-tell on the lawn
    outside to advertise our presence to the neighborhood.
