## Approval of [Previous Meeting's Minutes](Regular_Member_Meeting_2020_02_11)

Approved

## Recognition

-   Matt for 3D printing 40 face shields using his home printer and
    taking them to a hospital drop-off site

## New Members

No new members

## Old Business

-   Spring cleaning (but not gear cleaning) has begun. Clean those
    springs!

## New Business

-   Discussing options for 3D printing if people are interested in
    aiding in the production of face shields. Places are currently
    looking for face shields and not masks and hospitals usually will
    tell you what they are looking for. There was a coordinated
    organizing effort in Baltimore, but not any well-coordinated efforts
    close to home.
-   Capture the Flag is a hope for the future but we will wait until we
    can talk to Tristan
-   Tayeb will start the deep learning online course soon and it will be
    managed entirely online this time, allowing more people to join

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff)

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

Current balance is \$5597. We are in the black for the last two months
because we haven't yet paid rent in April or March. We are net +3567 in
April, net +1000 in March. We currently have 19 dues paying members, and
we have lost two members (or at least frequent donaters) over the past
month.

Matt also recommends doing a drive for PPE, offers to send email to
members list Karen asks if we have a method to tell the difference
between a one-time donation and a member. We want to be able to see if
we are losing members when we make the case to the church that we're
looking for a break on the rent
