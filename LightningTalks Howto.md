# how not to run lightning talks!

by [user:obscurite](user:obscurite) 11/21/2010

Since I'm no longer a DC denizen, and since my buddy William Gibb has
been asking about taking over the Lightning Talks, I decided to commit
my hard earned `<s>`{=html}wisdom`</s>`{=html} scars to the annals of
HacDC. Since a wiki document is alive, it's likely that by the time you
read this it may not be the document I originally created, but a much
better one. Bullet points are in no particular order and are sloppily
organized -- I'm sorry. Happy lightning talking.

HacDC Lightning Talks entry: [LightningTalks](LightningTalks)

## ORGANIZING

-   It takes weeks to collect a dozen speakers, so send email blasts to
    every listserv you can 2 months before the event, 1 month before the
    event, and 2 weeks before the event.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   IRC channels like #hacdc are also a surprisingly effective way to
    snag cool speakers. Speculation on the social implications of this
    observation have been removed by the author's better judgement.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Specify that speakers MUST send you their talk title and a
    description when they contact you. You want to screen out anything
    really wacky (religious, total crackpot, etc).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Specify that slides are optional or required. I prefer leaving it up
    the speaker, as some talks use props or audience interactions
    instead of slides. Just make sure the speaker makes this decision up
    front so they don't show up to a talk that needs slides without
    them.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Make sure that speakers are asked to provide special needs like
    audio amplification/mics, or live video. They must specify if they
    do not want their photo or video taken beforehand (make this crystal
    clear). Slides are run off a central computer, so if speakers need
    to use their own computer, they should also specify this.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Speakers will often leave slides until the last minute, so make a
    deadline at least 3 days before the event to give stragglers a
    chance to catch up.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Update the WIKI as you accept talks. Have a section under "upcoming
    lightning talks" with speakers and cancellations, with their topics
    and the speaker names. This will be useful for MC'ing when the time
    comes and lets people know what to expect.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Email each speaker when you receive their talk proposal to tell them
    if it's accepted and ask them about slides, special needs,
    permission to take photos/videos, tell them about the deadline, etc.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Keep your own private comma separated list of names/emails to paste
    into emails to the speakers.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Email the speakers no later than one weeks before the event to
    remind them that slides are due and where and when the event is.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Email the speakers 48 hours before the event to remind them. It's
    amazing how quickly people forget and never put things on their
    calendar... seriously - your speakers will forget and go drink beer
    instead.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Make sure you get your space (at St. Stephens or wherever) booked
    before you announce the event date. It can be a pain to let people
    know of changed dates, so it's easier to double confirm the
    reservation first. Good weather and low competition for cool things
    going on that night can result in up to 50-100 attendees if the
    event is very well announced/publicized, while it can be as few as
    10-20 on an off night.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   It may be nice to announce that after the speakers there will be
    some sort of social -- going to a bar or whatever. This depends on
    your energy level.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If a talk is an obvious win (interesting, novel, funny, etc) then
    approve it right away. If a talk is on the fence (for example a
    company giving a sales presentation) then hold off. In my
    experience, most talks are worth approving right away, so this is
    rarely a real issue.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Always get at least 2 backup speakers, for a total of 14 approved
    talks. Worst case scenario, you have 2 bonus talks. Generally at
    least 1-2 people are no-shows.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If you are running short of speakers, ask for a volunteer or two for
    the missing spots. Some of the best talks are just from people in
    the audience talking about the cool stuff they do.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Keep a master list of past and potential speakers to farm for future
    talks. Consider making a ltspeakers@hacdc.org list for these folks.
    Sometimes people want to speak but it takes them several months for
    the timing to work out.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   When you see cool projects, contact those involved to ask about
    presenting. Never pass up something/someone with a cool idea for the
    lighting talks! Get them onto your speakers list if they bite. I've
    done this mentally in the past but an actual list would work a lot
    better.

## MC'ING

-   Say something nice and fun t the crowd, like "Thanks for coming to
    the lightning talks. We have some awesome and fabulous talks about
    crazy stuff. HacDC is a nonprofit hackerspace that puts on great
    events like these. Support us with a donation or consider becoming a
    member! Lightning talks are 5 minutes long -- please save your
    inevitable questions for the end of our show, thanks!"

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If speakers invite audience participation that's cool, but people
    who interrupt with questions should be firmly asked to save it until
    the end. Tough love will keep the event running smoothly.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Run the slides off a Mac - they are less vulnerable to the viruses
    that speakers will inadvertently include in their presentations, and
    they tend to "just work". Adobe reader works better than some
    versions of the Mac preview program for slides. (this bullet point
    is at the discretion of the organizer of course, and if they are
    stupid enough to use a PC that's cool and good luck getting linux to
    work).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Start a timer with an audible ring when each speaker gets up to
    speak. Give a 1 minute warning (DO NOT BE AFRAID TO INTERRUPT THE
    SPEAKER. YOU ARE THE BOSS MAN/WOMAN!)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   When the timer goes off after 5 minute, politely but firmly tell the
    speaker they are out of time, and if they continue more than another
    30 seconds, STAND UP AND SPEAKER OVER THEM and announce the next
    speaker.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Announce speaker's name and talk title before they come up in a
    clear voice.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Try to arrange the order of the talks so that there is a good
    heterogeneous mixture of serious/technical and light/nontechnical
    throughout the talks to break things up. Knowing the speaking style
    of the folks helps, but generally try to mix it up and keep people
    guessing. Feel free to save a zinger for the end. :)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Try to announce the talk order when the event starts, but generally
    let people know when they're coming up to speak as soon as you can.
    I've sometimes told people while someone was speaking that they were
    next, which has worked out surprisingly well, but somehow doesn't
    seem ideal.

## TECHNICAL/INFRASTRUCTURE

-   Make sure wifi is available at the meeting place, but let speakers
    know that internet isn't a guarantee, but a hope. This will prevent
    people from relying solely on websites -- which hasn't been a
    problem in the past, but could become one very quickly when the
    internet is down for any given reason.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Set up the screen, projector, and laptop at least 30 minutes before
    showtime. If A/V is available, make sure that is working too. Tape
    down power cords preferably. Get a posse together (3-4 people max)
    to help out.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Load and test the slides on the laptop before the event (preferably
    24 hours before) if possible to catch stupid things like format
    conversion errors or whatever.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Make sure you have a VGA adapter or DVI adapter or both depending on
    what project is used. This can be a real PITA if the laptop with the
    slides doesn't have the right adapter.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Set the Projector where people on both sides of the room can see it.
    If the speaker/podium is blocking the screen from one side, ask the
    audience to sit on the side of the room where it's visible.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Have a designated A/V person to record, encode, and post the videos.
    This historically is a hard thing to nail down, but anyone with an
    iphone3gs+ or mini camcorder can fill in. Organize this at least two
    weeks beforehand and have a backup if possible.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   At the very least, make sure someone takes decent photos of the
    crowd and at least one speaker for the website. Once I forgot to do
    this and I felt really crappy. Pics or it didn't happen, as they
    say.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Organizer should post the slides to the wiki after the event and
    blast the speakers to let them know.

## SPEAKING

-   Prepare your slides by the deadline and revise them if needed before
    the event. Do not save this for the last second, or you will be
    missing out on making your talk as good as it can be. Just a little
    prep time goes a loooong way.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Speak in a clear, audible voice. Ask the audience if they can hear
    you in the back and speak up if not.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Practice and time your talk at least once to get the major kinks out
    and make sure the timing is right. Many speakers think they're
    giving a 5 minute talk, and only get halfway through when the alarm
    goes off because they didn't practice.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   It's better to finish at 3 or 4 minutes than to run out of time and
    not finish!

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Be natural and relaxed, don't try to fake it. If you're comfortable
    the audience will be too!

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If you're doing slides with any kind of multimedia, make sure the
    presentation converts to a format that can be played reliably on the
    presentation laptop being used (probably a Mac). It's not uncommon
    for sounds or video clips to get lost or fonts to get out of wack.
    PDF is a safe bet, though not as sexy.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Don't count on internet access. It'll probably be there, but it may
    not be. Email your slides to the organizer on time and in a format
    they can display.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If you need to do anything unusual like connect to remote servers,
    display videos, amplify audio, etc, then TELL THE ORGANIZER ASAP.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   If you plan to use some kind of novel presentation format like 100%
    audience participation please tell the organizer ASAP.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The organizer is responsible for the safety of all attendees and
    speakers. Do exactly what they tell you to do, please.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The MC will tell you when you have 1 minute remaining. If you're
    falling behind, summarize and bring the talk to an end as gracefully
    as possible. Don't leave the audience in the middle of your talk.

## FAQ

-   What is a lightning talk?
    -   Lightning talks are serial 5 minute presentations. The mode of
        the presentation is arbitrary but most often takes on the
        traditional form of slides and progressive explanation. The
        topic is more or less arbitrary within bounds of reason and
        should appeal to the sensibilities of the intended audience.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Who can give a lightning talk?
    -   Anyone can give a lightning talk on any topic and no standard of
        expertise is officially required, though a well researched talk
        is always preferred.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   How long is a lightning talks event?
    -   Lightning talks are typically about one hour long, with 10-14
        speakers.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Can I ask questions?
    -   Yes, if the speaker invites them, but otherwise wait until after
        the speakers are done for a QA session.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   How do I become a speaker?
    -   Get your a talk title and description to the organizer or MC
        right away. Your contribution is welcomed.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Why are lighting talks 5 minutes long instead of 10 or 15 minutes?
    Too short!
    -   While you're right that lightning talks are limited in scope due
        to time constraints, that's the point. The brevity serves two
        main purposes. First, the audience doesn't have a chance to lose
        interest - a good lightning talks generates more questions than
        it provides answers, much like good art. Second, speakers have
        limited pressure because they are only responsible for
        entertaining or educating the audience for 5 minutes, and
        lightning talks are supposed to be low-pressure and inclusive.
        Hopefully now you understand why 5 minutes is an ideal length
        for a lightning talk. Questions can be asked during QA for more
        details and talk slides are posted to the wiki after the event.
