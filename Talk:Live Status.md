## How to Update This Page Manually - *OBSOLETE*

Please copy one of the blocks below into the Live section. For the
curious, the
[onlyinclude](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Onlyinclude#Noinclude.2C_includeonly.2C_and_onlyinclude)
tag makes just that word show up on the home page in the live section.

### Open

    HacDC is currently: <onlyinclude>Open! (as of ~~~~~)</onlyinclude>

    Contact Phone Number: (so people know who to call to get in the space - feel free to spam-proof your number)

    Notes: 

    Signed: ~~~

Important!

1.  Include your phone number so people know who to call to get in,
    particularly after hours. (Once [Project Red
    Phone](Project_Red_Phone) is complete, this won't be
    necessary anymore.)
2.  Include the five tildes so there's a timestamp on your message. That
    way, if you forget to update this, people won't mistakenly come to
    the space.
3.  If you know what time you're going to leave, include that in the
    notes.

### Closed

    HacDC is currently: <onlyinclude>Closed (as of ~~~~~)</onlyinclude>

space)

I suspect that the usage instructions should be on the page itself, not
on this discussion page. Thoughts? - [Katie](User:Katie)
