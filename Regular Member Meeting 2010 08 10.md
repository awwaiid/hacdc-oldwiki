### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

Something shady with the POS? VP lost his wallet.

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}

William: Is really happy to be back from India. Had a lot of fun
painting HacDC.

Katie: Will be emailing all on the guest lists and asking them to join.
Movie night sometime soon. Will require laptop to drive video. Contact
her for details.

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

### Andy

-   Booze Class (was too busy talking to type).

### Redbeard

-   Did an advanced SSH class. Was well received.

### Elliot

-   Ash's Electronics class is ongoing. It's been going well. We have
    done etching and are moving on to actually making simple circuits.
    Amps are immanent.

### Arc

-   New project server set up in the hall. Talk to Arc about it if you
    want access.
-   Planning a Tues intro to programming class in Python to replace open
    slot for Disassembly Tues. in the next few weeks.
-   Would like to organize 1 night/week work party (Friday?).

### Todd

-   NARG is planning an ambient light project to have lights in the
    space that would be controllable through an open API (XMPP
    controlled). Could potentially evolve into a flexible network for
    controlling microcontroller projects in the space. These could then
    be left in the space and would instantly be networked.

### Katie

-   -   The Space Blimp is MIA. Got good measurements. Disappears @
        60,000 feet.
    -   Perhaps kidnapped by aliens. We are hoping that the aliens call
        us if they find it. It is a mystery.

### Daniel

-   New server. If anyone had a hacdc email address and wants to restore
    it, let Dan know.
    -   Call for sysadmins present.

## Old Business {#old_business}

### Parts Store {#parts_store}

Budget has been approved, but there isn't consensus yet.

### Nonprofit Paperwork Filing {#nonprofit_paperwork_filing}

Still in limbo. Redbeard following up every few days. Remains
unassigned; will be fast-tracked once it's assigned.

## New Business {#new_business}

### marketing meeting - August 24 {#marketing_meeting___august_24}

-   House warming party
    -   Submit any proposals to blabber. Pumping Station did a "geek
        prom", which seems like a good idea, given that we have the
        space to do it for free.
-   Membership packet
-   Todd: Action needs to be taken regarding new members and funds. It
    doesn't seem we've done quite enough to get energy into the space.
    Meeting proposed in two weeks for marketing.
-   Daniel: Proposes Town hall between membership meetings that is more
    town-hall action-oriented. Like a work sprint for programmatic
    things.

### setup new voip service {#setup_new_voip_service}

we can get voip service for \$1/mo (plus \$.01/min incoming calls) from
voip.ms (same as we're using now, Jason's account) and transfer the
Google Voice number (202-556-HACK) to it. This will make it easier to
fix when the phone goes out.

-   We had a VOIP outage, which, it turns out is very dependent on Jason
    to call if anything goes wrong. It would be better for us to have it
    and administer it ourself.

```{=html}

```
-   Daniel moves to approve \$50/yr budget. William Seconds. Motion
    passes.

### Clear internet "booster" {#clear_internet_booster}

The internet access at the church is a T1 (1.544 sync) plus DSL (1.544
async) being shared now with a computer lab downstairs and 14 other
offices, at times there's not enough bandwidth to run just our phone
much less highspeed downloads (.isos, git/hg syncing, etc). A 700meg
.iso recently took 9 hours to download. Availability for voip can (and
will) be improved with QoS (quality of service) on the router, but this
will not increase available bandwidth.

Clear 6m/1m internet access via wireless across the street from us. We
can join it with our vlan as an uplink (in addition to T1) without
sharing with the whole building, and costs only \$40/mo (and \$80 wimax
modem).

**No vote required at this time**

### Modern Device JeeNode kit order {#modern_device_jeenode_kit_order}

There is currently interest in the JeeNode, an AVR-based Arduino clone
with a built-in multi-node radio.

`Â `[`http://www.moderndevice.com/products/jeenode-kit`](http://www.moderndevice.com/products/jeenode-kit)

Individual HacDC members want to buy them, there is talk of a workshop,
and NARG group members are thinking of using them in their ambient
device network project. They are \$22.50 each but ModernDevice.com has a
16% discount for quantities of 10 or more (\$18.90 each). Since I am
doing a similar order of Adafruit.com kits I offered to coordinate a
ModernDevice kit order as well. I would place with order with HacDC
funds and make the kits available for a suggested donation with a bit of
"profit" built in as I'm doing with Adafruit. This "profit" would
initially be folded back into stocking the kits but will eventually be
returned to HacDC.

Arc Riley assures me that there is a lot of demand for the kits (\>=14
people currently) and suggests ordering a batch of 20. Since we would
also want to order some JeeLink Modules at \$36.50 and probably some
USB\<-\>Serial converters at \$14 the dollar values will add up quickly.
Here are some possible order levels:

Item, Qty, Price Ea., Total\
JeeNode v4 kit 20 \$18.90 \$378.00\
USB BUB Board 4 \$14.00 \$56.00\
JeeLink Module 4 \$36.50 \$146.00\
ModerDevice total: \$580.00\
\
JeeNode v4 kit 15 \$18.90 \$283.50\
USB BUB Board 3 \$14.00 \$42.00\
JeeLink Module 3 \$36.50 \$109.50\
ModerDevice total: \$435.00\
\
JeeNode v4 kit 10 \$18.90 \$189.00\
USB BUB Board 3 \$14.00 \$42.00\
JeeLink Module 3 \$36.50 \$109.50\
ModerDevice total: \$340.50\
Please discuss and approve whatever size of purchase everyone is
comfortable with. I am happy to place future orders once these sell out,
so the smaller orders will cost only shipping (\~\$7 for ground from RI)
and time delay.

I will try to pursue an additional "hackerspace discount" with Modern
Device, and (if people think it is okay) would even talk about having
them sponsor some of the NARG ambient project with hardware in exchange
for acknowledgement and links in the project writeups and publicity.
