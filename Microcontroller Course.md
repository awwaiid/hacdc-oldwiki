## Five-Part Microcontroller Course {#five_part_microcontroller_course}

What: A five-part microcontroller course, taking you from zero to hero
in just 30 days!

Where: The space.

When: Monday nights, 7:00pm to 9:00pm (nominally). Sept 8 through Oct 6
2011.

### Syllabus

Each class will be about 30 min introductory lecture, 20 min lab, 20 min
lecture, 20 min lab. We’ll cover two big topics per night (usually) and
get cool projects working for each.

1.  Setup: What the AVRs are, what all the pins do, what it can do for
    you. Then the toolchain: soldering together the programmer kits,
    getting the software up and running. Reading the datasheets. Labs:
    building the kit and running a test LED flasher. (Almost all lab
    today, little talk.)
2.  Outputs and bit math: How to make chips speak to the outside world,
    pin-by-pin. Enough C programming fundamentals to make it work.
    Pulse-width modulation. Labs: Cylon eyes and dimming LED’s. Extra
    credit: cross-fading cylon eyes!
3.  Inputs: Buttons and Analog-to-Digital conversion (ADC). Gather data
    input the world. Labs: pushbutton organ, light-dependent theremin.
    Extra credit: something else!
4.  Interrupts and Timers: Interrupts call subroutines when certain
    conditions are true. Timers let you time stuff. Together, they take
    a lot of the programming burden off your shoulders, and enable
    really cool stuff. Labs: Driving servo motors and/or build a better
    audio synth, use an LED as a light-source and light-sensor. Extra
    credit: capacitive touch-switch!
5.  Serial I/O: Make the micro speak to your computer (and vice-versa).
    We can also cover other serial protocols (I2C, SPI). Labs: Basic
    serial in/out, data-logging light sensor. Maybe SD/MMC cards? Extra
    credit: ADC + serial output + Python + laptop = ghetto oscilloscope.
6.  EEPROM, PROGMEM, etc: Tying up loose ends, special requests. PROGMEM
    lets you use the program memory to store lots of (constant) data.
    EEPROM is like flash — there’s not much of it, but it stays when you
    power off. Can also do misc topic requests here. Labs: writing out
    really long strings to serial, saving last known states for battery
    failure. Maybe I can think up something sexy to use these methods.
    Maybe not.

### The Kit {#the_kit}

The class will be based around the ATMega 48 (\$4 in bulk). The basics
of a programming kit for the AVR chips include: a computer (bring a
laptop), a programmer (\$22), a breadboard (\$5). We’ll be rounding out
the projects with some push-buttons, LEDs, light-sensing resistors,
speakers, and servo motors. Some of this stuff is in the space, some
I’ll bring in, and some will be bought for you all. \$35 for the basic
kit, delivered.

For \$20 more, you can opt to get a super-swanky USB/TTL-serial cable,
which will enable simple and clean bi-directional communication with
laptops. I highly recommend ponying up for one if you think you’ll
continue using micros, but if you want to kludge something together out
of a plain-old USB/RS-232 Serial converter, I can help.

kind of kit you want and if you’re interested but bringing your own
gear.
