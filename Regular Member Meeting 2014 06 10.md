## Director Reports

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

-   1 server is configured and ready to use
    -   still needs a 3U or smaller PSU \>=500W to be able to close the
        case
-   Wiki and main site experiencing difficulties due to what appears to
    be Dreamhost shared hosting being overrun by something we don't
    control.

### Treasurer's Report

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for May 2014:
![](HacDC_Financials_2014_05.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2014_05.pdf"). We did
not gain any new members, and we lost three members: Ann Millspaugh,
Griffin Boyce, and Sharad Satsangi. We have 43 dues-paying members in
good standing, 8 dues-waived members, and 5 members who are behind on
dues.

#### Project Awesome

Here is the Project Awesome spreadsheet for May:
![](HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_05.pdf "HacDC_PA_Projects-2014_05.pdf").
Since we had to dip into our savings again (to the tune of \$400+) to
pay our rent, I did not declare a Project Awesome dividend for the month
of May.

## Member Reports

### mirage335

#### Busy

Have been busy, personally and professionally.

![](MRocks.jpg "MRocks.jpg")

Boulder estimated at 1 metric ton. From buried yard debris to
decoration.

#### OS

Have created a Gentoo/Funtoo ebuild/package overlay incorporating most
of my enhancements. Additionally plan to host more enhancements on a
local server at HacDC. Plan to deploy several laptops with KDE and other
things.

#### Optical Table

Heard we now have the engine hoist at HacDC. Perhaps that could be used
to deploy the table after the meeting.

#### Equipment

Need to make the space inviting, which means fully operational equipment
and cleaned up spaces. To that end, might borrow one of the 3D printers
to try various firmware, and will set up some laptops with usable Linux
software.
