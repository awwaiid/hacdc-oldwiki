## Director Reports

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for November 2013:
![](HacDC_Financials_2013_11.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2013_11.pdf"). We
gained one new member, Griffin Boyce, and lost no members, though a
number of members failed to pay dues this month.

#### Project Awesome

Here is the Project Awesome spreadsheet for November:
![](HacDC_PA_Projects-2013_11.pdf "HacDC_PA_Projects-2013_11.pdf"). I'm
able to declare a \$300 Project Awesome dividend and add \$137.87 to our
un-earmarked reserves for the month of November. There were 16 Project
Awesome votes.

### Secretary's Report

Nothing significant to report.

(unable to attend meeting, probably traveling atm)

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### [Shawn Nock](User:Nocko)

#### Reuven

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports

### Project LASER

### Project BYZANTIUM

### Project KITBUILD

### Project SUPPLIES

#### Financial Outlook

Healthy and stable at \~\$1.4k.

### Recent Purchases

-   2 1kg PLA Filament Spools
-   Glass cutter, several glass sheets.
-   T25 Torx Bit

### Prusa Mendel

Bed leveling issues became an increasing nuisance, due to a lack of
suitable glass and clamps. Using dremel tool, glass cutter, and laser
cutter, I have finally finished a multilayer through-hole mounted glass
bed.

This took weeks of experimentation and shattered glass that would have
been much easier if we already had a wide-area CNC built on the optical
table.

### Future Plans

After cleanup at HacDC, can consider improving generic supplies like
mill stock, electronic components, laser cutter stock, and hardware (ie.
screws).

### Project EXPANSION

#### Financial Outlook

Off to a good start. At \$87.19, need to wait a little longer before we
can buy more equipment. Then again, we need to finish cleanup first
anyway.

#### Future Plans

As noted on the [Project
Tracker](http://mirage335.dyndns.org/hacdcprojects/index.php?m=projects&a=view&project_id=6),
Vertical Bandsaw and Server are top-priority items.

Vertical bandsaw has been specifically cited as an example of the kind
of metal/wood/plastic working tool required at HacDC.

High-end VM server will be used to PXE boot the WYSE terminals into high
powered computers.

### Project SPACECAM

## Member Reports

### mirage335

#### Basement Shelves & Cleanup

Members are encouraged to discuss floor plan options with mirage335
after the meeting.

##### The Debate

Despite a full CAD model, lengthy comment period, and general consensus
that the shelves should be built, all well in advance of their
construction, suggestions have emerged to cut down the new shelves,
among other things.

Please consider:

1.  If the shelves were not built, we would still be doing nothing
    effective about lack of storage, cleanup, or equipment workstations,
    probably for several more years.
2.  Cutting down the new shelves could delay cleanup and equipment
    workstations more months and years. Every project risks
    non-completion.
3.  Alternative uses for the basement are going nowhere at that rate
    anyway.
4.  Smaller shelves will not give us any unused storage space, leaving
    no room for growth.

Also, it is worth noting:

1.  AFAIK, HacDC is paying very little rent for that basement, among
    other things I might say on that point.
2.  About \$300 and four person-days of effort have gone into the
    shelves. Jeopardizing that needs something to show for doing so.
3.  Those who want something dramatically different can build it,
    demonstrate that it works, and THEN propose removal of older
    solutions.
4.  Personally, I have put in at least several hundred hours cleaning up
    the space as well as maintaining HacDC's 3D printer and laser
    cutter. At least half that time was wasted due to lack of
    maneuvering room, a problem these shelves are needed to solve.

On the positive side, there are some more reasonable ways to address
concerns raised in the debate, outlined below. Also, next time I propose
something like this (if ever...), dimensions will be included in the
render image.

##### Wheels

At a cost of approximately \$43.17, we can add wheels to the shelves
capable of supporting 1.6 metric tons. Additional wheels or fixed
supports can be fitted later.

<https://raw.github.com/mirage335/OpenBuildings/master/Units/Shelves/Render.png>

Since some concerns have been raised about placing more than a metric
ton on wheels, this should probably be done only if members absolutely
insist on pushing the shelves against a wall.

##### Floor Plans

<https://github.com/HacDC/FloorPlan/raw/master/FloorPlans/BasementBackRoom/BasementBackRoom_ShelvesAsideLeft.pdf>

Floor plans are still in progress, derived from the Solidworks 3D models
published on [github](https://github.com/HacDC/FloorPlan). Other members
are invited to explore alternative layouts using these files.

Also, the tables and carts modeled are not only speculative, but
intended to be shared with both rooms in the basement. At any time,
members could push the carts out of whichever room is most in use, or
perhaps even temporarily outside.

##### Policy Changes

Some have objected to HacDC storing anything at all. While this probably
is not a growth-oriented viewpoint, the need for a more effective, well
publicized disposal policy, may be. I have been attempting help out by
drafting such a policy.

[ExcessDisposal](ExcessDisposal)

Features include:

-   Specific "Stays at HacDC Criteria" with time limits.
-   Going-out-pile and rotation processes.
-   Disposal processes.
-   Conflict resolution (BOD approval).

However, it has been suggested that policy changes should wait at least
until January, which seems reasonable.

#### Flex Replicator / Optical Table CNC

Soon as the Optical Table is on its feet, will outfit it with gantry
hardware and a variety of tools. This is compatible with the Flex
Replicator, but much larger and more accurate.

We will then be able to mill out the kind of large parts that have been
hand-crafted at great expense and labor for our 3D printer and laser
cutter.

**This is urgent. Lack of a large area CNC has recently cost at least 75
hours of my time at HacDC while maintaining 3D printer and laser cutter,
and more projects are waiting.**

#### Biohacking

##### Imagnus

We may need to recruit more participation from other HacDC members soon,
and the compensation structure for me and HacDC is still being worked
out.

Also, a lot of interesting progress is being made on a really cool
product.

##### Biosignal Amplifier

All the hardware is in place, usage will soon be simplified to a USB
plug-and-play device. GNURadio has proven insufficiently flexible, and a
new rapid prototyping environment called
[SigBlockly](http://mirage335.dyndns.org/wiki/Category:SigBlockly#Progress)
is under construction.

This environment will allow graphical 'drag-and-drop' development of DSP
C programs, similar to, but much more powerful than
[blocklyduino](http://www.gasolin.idv.tw/public/blockly/demos/blocklyduino/index.html).

##### Thursday Meetings

The Thursday biohacking meetings have been getting quiet, but the core
members still occasionally drop by and express interest. With the
biosignal amplifier nearly finished, and hopefully more tools deployed
at HacDC, we should be able to resume other projects.

#### WYSE Terminals

Created persistent USB stick image for the WYSE terminals, documented at
[Linux_on_Wyse_Winterm_S10_Thin_Clients](Linux_on_Wyse_Winterm_S10_Thin_Clients).
Trick is to use an old version of syslinux.

Tested about two dozen units. Surprisingly, all are functional, capable
of USB and presumably PXE booting.

#### myDAQ and myDSP

Special thanks to Ahmed Aden for making a special trip to bring the
myDAQ and myDSP back to us.

#### Projector/OpenDisplay

Still need 3 more giant fresnel lenses from old projection TVs
[craigslist](http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/zip?query=projection&zoomToPosting=&srchType=A&minAsk=&maxAsk=).

Also, a modular pallet-and-rail will be used for the optics this time.
The prototype frame that has been taking up space in the workshop is no
longer useful, and will be disassembled immediately.

#### Occupancy Sensor

Working reliably.

## Old Business

### Shelves

\$600 for shelves to mirage.

-   Quorum not met, could not vote.

### Honorary Memberships

#### The Doctor

The Doctor is one of the founding members of Project Byzantium and one
of the largest contributors to the project. He has made numerous other
contributions including donating time and equipment to improve the
space, and helping us to network with other individuals and
organizations with shared interests.

#### Bradford Barr

Former President of HacDC. He is also headed off the SF. Brad has been a
long-time supporter of HacDC's mission. He donated a lot of time to
HacDC over the years including teaching a number of classes on a variety
of topics from Python to lockpicking to yo-yos.

#### R. Mark Adams, PhD {#r._mark_adams_phd}

Long time member and contributor to the space.

## New Business

-   Zach purchased materials for basement shelves, and should now be
    reimbursed up to \$400 (exact receipt value is not known to
    mirage335).
-   Approving another \$75 will allow wheels to be added to the shelves.
    That is not to say the wheels will be added just because their
    budget was approved.
-   Katie proposes we allocate \$100 for our traditional holiday gift to
    the security guard.
