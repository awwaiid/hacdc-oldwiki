## Cart Transport

Exhibitors will be allowed to hand-carry in one trip worth of items for
their booth. You must be able to carry it by yourself with no help from
people or equipment (backpacks okay). Everything else will need to be
brought in from the loading dock to our booth on a cart by Hargrove, the
union drayage service. We have coupons for two 3'x5' cart-loads of
stuff. They will unload the stuff from our vehicle and move it (by cart)
to our booth, and then we would go set it up I suppose. If you will need
to haul your stuff on a cart, please sign up here:

-   **Who, What, Size (WxLxH), When**
-   Tim Slagle, Plotter, 2.5x1.5x1 feet, Friday afternoon?
-   Tim Slagle, LED Message Ball in box, 1.5x1.5x2', Friday afternoon?

**Everything going by cart will need to be labelled with HacDC and our
booth number, which is 2250.**
