Suggest requiring all loaned items to be labeled.
:   Could be as little as just a name on a piece of masking tape but
    something to identify it as non-Hac property. Loaned items tend to
    stick around a while and we forget that they're loaned.. until the
    day the owner wants them back and we discover the item(s) have been
    hacked or removed from the space.

Speedy Disposal

Criteria that might enable speedy decision making:

-   Low value items (\<\$50 commercial value).
-   Not meeting any of the "Stays at HacDC Criteria.
-   Item and inside components accurately characterized.

:   As a 501(c)3 organization, we need to use a process (ie. the going
    out pile) which ensures individuals do not benefit at the
    organization's expense. A such, it is not yet clear whether we can
    authorize a less bureaucratic disposal process than the going out
    pile. **This subject needs a legal expert.**
