Wiki admin contact point?
:   Hey Katie, I'm bugging you only b/c you were the last to edit the
    wiki's main page.
:   It looks like ImageMagick is missing from the wiki's server. This
    means thumbnails cannot be generated so images are stuck at their
    uploaded size. Is there someone I could contact to kindly install
    it?
:   Thanks, David Mc â†’ [Gatohaus](User:Gatohaus) 14:14, 9

## Page protection

Thanks for protecting [HacDC Multi-touch
device](HacDC_Multi-touch_device). Any idea why that one page
was such a target? You might considered installing
[Extension:ReCAPTCHA](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ReCAPTCHA)
to prevent anonymous autonomous bots from adding links to pages. So far
it has prevented all of the spam postings on my Mediawiki installations.
