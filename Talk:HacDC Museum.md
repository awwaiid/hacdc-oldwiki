Has anyone been to the Museum of Useful things in Cambridge?
Unfortunately it's now closed, but it used to be a combined store and
museum, with old and interesting gadgets displayed in cases and above
head level around the store. It's the first thing that came to mind when
Ben proposed a HacDC museum. The Museum of Useful Things still exists
online, but primarily as a store. I couldn't find much on their site
about the things in their collection, but there are a few pages
([Example](http://themut.com/exhibits/2/)).

One thing that I liked about the physical store is that they often
displayed old and new versions of the same product (with the new version
available to buy). For example, this [staple-free
stapler](http://themut.com/zoomprod/product72/) was displayed under a
model that looked more like one of [these
guys](http://www.officemuseum.com/stapler_gallery_stapleless.htm).

:   Sounds like a really interesting concept. I'd love to aim for a more
    expansive display of artifacts, space permitting, and if the Museum
    is wildly successful, perhaps its own space someday in the distant
    future. The idea of a store is intriguing, as well. Perhaps as HacDC
    grows, there could be something akin to the [826
    Valencia](http://www.826valencia.org/) model, where a fun storefront
    (They have a Pirate Store, a superhero store, and a Bigfoot Research
    Institute) is the gateway to a spectacular hacking/teaching space
    and proceeds are used to subsidize the programs of HacDC. We're a
    long way from that, but it's something to consider.

## Name Controversy

There's been some debate about whether to name the collection after our
first large benefactor, and whether to identify objects in the
collection as having been donated by certain individuals. A suggestion
has been made by Derek Cooper to contact the benefactor's family to
verify permission to use the name, but to avoid a potentially
embarrassing situation, I think it would be wise to see if the group is
in favor of naming a part of the collection after the benefactor before
asking for permission.

Those **in favor** of naming the collection after the benefactor,
pending permission from his heirs

Those **opposed** to naming the collection after the benefactor

-   [Bjorn](User:Bjorn) 06:44, 13 June 2008 (UTC) - Anonymity
    was a good idea. We can have full disclosure of what is really too
    great a story to keep under raps. It keeps things impersonal, and I
    don't see what anyone has to gain from non-anonymous entanglement.
    Besides, I have other items I'd contribute, and I'd expect this sort
    of donation will become a regular occurrence - lets just keep things
    neutral. What Mrs. X did was very kind, but lets keep the exchange
    as agreed upon initially.

:   

    :   I think that whenever possible, we should honor the wishes of
        donors (or their families, when applicable), so whatever we
        decide about identifying or not identifying this benefactor
        shouldn't determine what we do with future donations. If you
        were to contribute items and request anonymity, I don't see any
        problem with granting it. I would also disagree that removing
        the personal items would mean keeping a great story under wraps.
        We don't really have a story--we have some fun speculations
        about how the items in the boxes might have been used, with no
        way of substantiating them. While it's fun to bat around amusing
        theories, I personally wouldn't publicize this personal "story"
        even if the donor remained anonymous.

### Discussion Relating to Name Controversy

-   I think we can be selective about what we put in the "official"
    museum collection, but there is other interesting, amusing
    (embarrassing?) stuff that was in the boxes that has been
    photographed and put up on Flickr--and more that has yet to be
    photographed, no doubt. Even if it doesn't end up in the museum, it
    wouldn't be difficult for someone to go to HacDC's Flickr group and
    see the unofficial stuff mixed in with the official. Given the email
    from the widow, I do think it would be nice to name a collection or
    something after this guy, but if we do that, then I will take down
    my pictures of anything that I think might embarrass his family.

-   I see the collection breaking into four categories:

1.  Innocent, unidentifiable items: Telephones, test gear. These could
    be exhibited with a name, with no trouble at all.
2.  Innocent, identifiable items: Patent notebooks, research he was
    involved in. Even if partially redacted, someone who did a little
    digging could connect these with him. But by itself, that would do
    no harm.
3.  Risque or embarrassing items: Some of these are interesting but I
    wouldn't want to connect them with the family name. \[Could we have
    some clarification on the nature of these items? I.e., what about
    them is risque or potentially embarrassing?
    [Katie](User:Katie) 16:18, 14 June 2008 (UTC)\]
4.  Dangerous items: I won't discuss these further in a public forum.

It seems to me that any combination of 1, 2, and 3 would work, since if
someone wants to do the digging and figure out who printed those fart
jokes, the "damage" is minimal. It'd be better to avoid mixing 2 and 3,
if we wish to play it safe in that regard. But 4 absolutely cannot
appear with 2. And honestly, for our own safety, I don't think 4 should
appear or be mentioned at all. If you disagree, please do so in person.
In general, I think our best course is (1 & 3), with redaction of 3 if
necessary. We're under no obligation to name anything, and some stuff in
3 is really neat. If we want to pay tribute to the widow's generosity,
we could do so in a way not connected with the collection. (Just list
her as a donor, or something.) [Myself](User:Myself) 18:27,

-   We can avoid reputation/embarrassment if we simply call it the
    \_\_\_ \_\_\_ Museum, and then write in the "About" section that the
    man started our collection with a few fine pieces. We don't have to
    say what things came from him unless we want to. Let people assume
    that we got the embarrassing items from elsewhere. Also, it gives us
    some instant legitimacy and validity. It's a small compensation for
    the incorrect but popular sense of the verb "hack" that I all love
    and hate.

Or how about another compromise: The Patent Examiner's Collection, by
HacDC.

Also, after my experience with startupDC, I don't underestimate what the
Washington post is willing to feature. This could be a Post story one
day. What would you like on your Post article?

Also, what would our contemporaries do? Do you think NYCResister would
jump at the opportunity? Would they write an article about him with
photo's? I started to Google his name the other day. There are a few
tidbits, including someone that thinks that he should be shot. I'll stop
there to spike your curiosity. :)
