I have had a generally positive experience with Linode for several
years. They seem to be near the top of the pack in terms of
price/performance ratio (for Xen VPS). I have used Dreamhost shared
hosting for several projects, it can be sluggish... however it would be
easy for a non-admin to maintain and the price is right.

I added ServInt and ZipServers because they have datacenters and staff
in the DC area. A discount or a sponsorship may be possible.

I have personally had great performance with container based
virtualization both OpenVZ and (more recently) LXC for projects at work.
The container based virtualization universally has less overhead (there
is no hypervisor). I think that a container would serve us very well.
However, I do not have any experience with a commercial OpenVZ,
Virtuozzo, Linux-VServer, or LXC VPS vendor so I don't know who to
recommend.
