## Project Summary

**Project Code:** SEM **Project Contact:** Julia Longtin **Project
Status:** Active

**Project Description:** Formalize, fund, and accelerate the efforts
required to realize a fully operational Scanning Electron Microsope\[1\]
(SEM) including its operation, maintenance, and stewardship.

**License or IP status:** Project developments are not expected to be
affected by upstream licensing

**Additional Info:** Supporting acquisition, refurbishment, operation,
and stewardship of a Scanning Electron Microscope\[1\] (SEM) provides
for a unique ability to train a new generation of scientists and
engineers, develop radically new technology, greatly improve public
relations for hackers, attract new funding and talent, and further
distinguish HacDC in its unique Washington DC location. A SEM and
knowledgeable operators are neither a piece of equipment nor a skill set
readily available among the general public. Such equipment covers all
STEM\[2\] fields and has a wide-range of applications, with
electron-beam lithography\[3\] being something most relevant to the
immediate interests of a hacker space.

The project will proceed in four foreseeable stages which do not need to
be carried out serially, but their order of importance should be ranked
as such.

1.  The first stage will focus on refurbishing the existing Cambridge
    Stereoscan S200\[4\]\[5\]\[6\] to an operational state.
2.  The second stage will focus on ensuring and maintaining operability
    of the SEM for various approved tasks (i.e. typical sample
    operation, lithography, etc).
3.  The third stage will focus on enhancing existing functionality (i.e.
    SEM PCB reproduction, X-ray spectroscopy).
4.  The fourth stage will focus on expanding on success which will
    likely be contingent on proven success (i.e. considering and
    acquiring more modern microscopy equipment).

The project owner desires to run this project as a representative
meritocracy, allowing all members a reasonable opportunity to push
proposals and vote, but with oversight by the Board of Directors who
will be responsible for providing stewardship of rare and historic
equipment and long-term investments.

**Examples of equipment or services that may be needed or desired at one
time or another:**

-   High voltage multimeter and/or oscilloscope probes, built or
    purchased fully assembled
-   Discrete PCB components for replacement (i.e. resistors, capacitors,
    relays, ICs, etc.)
-   Pump repair kits and oil
-   Vacuum seal parts and grease
-   Cleaning solvents
-   Desiccant dehumidifier
-   Sputter coating machine and alloy material
-   Surplus add-on equipment (i.e. X-ray spectroscopy)
-   FPGA kits for circuit board reproduction
