For the purpose of education amongst it's members, HacDC maintains a set
of Debian notebook computers. These are used for the purposes of
learning linux administration, pentesting, and network security.

Currently (2016) these are Dell Core / Core Duo notebooks with 32GB USB
live boot Flash drives. They are stored on the classroom shelves. Please
occasionally boot and update them (apt update && apt upgrade).
