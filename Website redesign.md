## Integration and Single Sign-on {#integration_and_single_sign_on}

-   Use open-ID as a short term SSO solution
-   Look to LDAP as a long term ideal solution for web+system account
    management of user groups, permissions
-   Anyone can write an app in any platform if they implement Open-ID

## How to extend website for sub groups {#how_to_extend_website_for_sub_groups}

-   Groups may need their own sub-site functions. (How to do this. Maybe
    a drupal page like for projects? also how not to let this go stale?)

## Brainstorming/Ideas (from long ago) {#brainstormingideas_from_long_ago}

My list of potential improvements (that I can recall off the top of my
head) is something like:

-   Reduce white space
-   Use more media (Flickr pool, podcasts, videos of events, images in
    general)
-   Emphasize donation and membership (age old nonprofit trick)
-   Make it fast and easy to find out what the hottest goings-ons are in
    terms of projects, events
-   Better calendar
-   Use the Civicrm stuff ben installed to do event management
    eventbrite style
-   Allow people to hook up circuits to the site somehow (TFine
    mentioned an idea that sounded like a circuit gallery)
-   I thought it would be cool to build some kind of basic AI into the
    site to determine colors, content organization, etc. Will think more
    about this.

Discussion with Ben Stanfield on 12/8

-   Featured events and projects
-   Flickr feed
-   Podcast
-   Membership/Donate
-   doorman
-   we'll look at drupal themes and consider purchasing one from
    topnotchthemes if we find one worthwhile, otherwise we'll find a
    decent free theme and customize it
-   potentially use panels (ajax tabs) for a media section on homepage?
-   maybe have a "terminal mode" that uses DrupalShell (as presented at
    last lightning talks) for a command line mode for geeky fun

Obscurite's other random ideas: - have our IRC bot be able to twitter
URLs it detects from IRC and then have the website suck those up into a
"what people are discussing" block on the site. Would need a way to
filter/remove undesirable content (maybe moderated?)

## Drupal Themes {#drupal_themes}

Orange:

-   nice multicolumn layout with media area?
-   <http://drupal.org/project/orange>

Fields:

-   nice multi-column with wide graphic
-   <http://drupal.org/project/fields_2009>

Elements:

-   nice elegant layout
-   <http://drupal.org/project/elements_theme>

## Inspiration from other sites {#inspiration_from_other_sites}

-   AlphaOneLabs.com
    -   Great slider with images from recent events
    -   Great contact information (twitter, etc)
