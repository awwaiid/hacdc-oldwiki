-   We should edit the bylaws so the board of directors' terms are
    staggered. Having a complete board turnover last year was not great.

```{=html}

```
-   The White House is hosting a National Manufacturing Day
    (https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/08/call-action-celebrate-manufacturing-today-and-tomorrow)
    and part of the aim of the event is to "Linking manufacturers to the
    Maker movement by serving as the anchor tenant for a regional
    makerspace or supporting maker spaces in schools and after-school
    programs." I'm not sure what this means for HacDC except that it's a
    national makerspace/hackerspace event at the White House, down the
    road, with people who know what government programs can support
    hackerspaces. The event is Friday, October 7th. If there's a
    possibility of HacDC having an info table or booth, it sounds like a
    good idea to me...

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The memorandum of understanding (MOU) with High School Technology
    Services that allows them to use HacDC's classroom during business
    hours is expiring. They would like to renew it.

*Four month extension to the MOU passed with 5 in favor, no opposition.*

## Director Reports {#director_reports}

### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

IT systems are functioning nominally. Replaced the classroom Wifi since
the 5Ghz hardware was not stable. Also got the classroom room mic
working for the web conferencing. Need to fix whatever broke the WebRTC
compatibility. Also fixed a Wifi AP for the church and provided general
email support. Haven't set up the Linux repo mirrors yet, plan on doing
that soon.

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

Still fixing the issue that I didn't bill some people in June. Generally
things are OK. See sheet below.
![](HacDC_2016_-_Report-8_(1).pdf "HacDC_2016_-_Report-8_(1).pdf")

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}

#### Mike

#### Matt

All Starlight accounts also provide SMTP/POP/IMAP email service.

ReverseProxy for HTTP/HTTPS sites on HacDC servers are now redundant.

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project SUPPLIES {#project_supplies}

Nothing to report.

### Project EXPANSION {#project_expansion}

Nothing to report.

### Project HAMRADIO {#project_hamradio}

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM) {#project_electron_microscope_sem}

Our President Julia has volunteer to cover the delta costs from PA SEM
funds to purchase the digital vacuum gauge. Need to work on ordering
that.

### Project Optical Table Robot (OTR) {#project_optical_table_robot_otr}

### Project CRISPR {#project_crispr}

<http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/HacDC_CRISPR>

We received the DIY CRISPR kit and inventoried it. We've made the small
classroom fridge a "NO FOOD" project fridge because we now have bacteria
cultures in there. The cultures and DNA and RNA require refrigeration.
(The bacteria is E. Coli HME63, if anyone is curious.) The recipe
("protocol") takes multiple days due to incubation periods, so we're
going through it once to verify we can actually do it with the equipment
on-hand. Expect we'll have materials left over to repeat the experiment
several more times.

### Project Spaceblimp {#project_spaceblimp}

We have had several fantastic meetings and are starting to break out in
to individual teams based on project area outlined in the [Spaceblimp
6](HacDC_Spaceblimp_6) page. Please email me or one of the
lists if you would like to be on the spaceblimp@hacdc.org email list. We
are looking for members to contribute their PA funds for PA Spaceblimp
and are taking individual donations that can include parts/components.
The Funding team would like to ask the membership about adding a special
Spaceblimp donation link directly on the HacDC website, possibly close
below the HacDC donation link on the left rail. The Spaceblimp donation
link would be up for no more than 6 months.

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

Kevin reports the FLIR One software on Linux compiles OK and complains
no device is connected (which is correct).

```{=html}

```

:   2016-08-09 20:32 `<thomisthoss>`{=html} mirage are our new starlight
    e-mail addressed by \@hacdc.org?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:33 `<thomisthoss>`{=html} ...no i guess not as it
    would conflict with google apps

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:34 `<mirage335>`{=html} thomisthoss:
    \@starlight.srv.hacdc.org

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:35 `<mirage335>`{=html} We \*could\* manage our own
    \@hacdc.org email through Starlight, but I'd suggest putting that
    off until next year.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:35 `<mirage335>`{=html} Right now, the email isn't
    redundant through Nebula.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:39 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} The major reason our email is
    hosted by Gapps is by outsourcing the hosting, we don't have to
    worry about our email being and no one having the time to work on it

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:40 `<mirage335>`{=html} +1

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:40 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} Just like the majority of what
    it takes to run a web site, is handled by Dreamhost

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:41 `<mirage335>`{=html} ITechGeek: A major reason for
    providing email service on Starlight is to relay for sites that
    need/want to manage their own mail. There has already been a request
    for that capability.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:43 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} I didn't say anything against
    having starlight.srv.hacdc.org MX, just moving \@hacdc.org to
    starlight

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:43 `<mirage335>`{=html} Right, and I agree with you.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:46 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} Is anyone using starlight for
    outgoing email?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:49 `<ITechGeek>`{=html}
    <https://support.google.com/a/answer/2956491>

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:51 `<foxlet>`{=html} I use Mailgun.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:56 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} So do I

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:56 `<mirage335>`{=html} Not yet. The issue was more or
    less incoming mail more than outgoing.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:56 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} HacDC shouldn't use mailgun
    for Starlight unless HacDC is prepared to pay a bill from some
    random member's misconfigured script

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:57 `<mirage335>`{=html} Hmm.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:57 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} Mailgun is free for the first
    10k msgs, after that they charge

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:57 `<mirage335>`{=html} Well, in any case, Starlight
    runs its own email server.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:57 `<mirage335>`{=html} As do I.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:57 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} But because of the reverse
    DNS, some servers might not want to accept email from it

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:58 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} But it looks like we can relay
    10k emails through Gapps

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 20:58 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} 10k / day

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 21:00 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} So we can whitelist the
    church's IP on Gapps, and you could configure Starlight to send all
    emails out through Gapps if planning to use for outgoing

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 21:05 `<thomisthoss>`{=html} Ok.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 21:09 `<ITechGeek>`{=html} What are we voting on?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 21:09 `<thomisthoss>`{=html} voting on new MOU

    minutes fast?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

:   2016-08-09 21:12 `<mirage335>`{=html} I would have abstained from
    that vote anyway.
