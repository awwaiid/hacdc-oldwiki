## Old Business

-   John wants to make sure that cleaning the space stays on the radar,
    and Tayeb will look for additional recycling options because Ft
    Totten is not currently accepting recycling.

## New Business

-   Karen -- We want to host online activities at HacDC, to keep us
    active during the lockdown. Luis may be able to spearhead a "work
    simultaneously on a project with multiple people". Luis will work
    with John Pancoast to design a receiver for people to build for the
    foxhunt. There could also be a class online to set up an rtl-sdr as
    the receiver for a foxhunt
-   Matt to lead class on 3D printing. The first class can be a
    discussion of how to use your 3D printer to print PPE for use by
    hospitals. Matt will get in contact with local hospitals to assess
    need and requirements for helping

## Member Reports

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff)

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

Current balance is \$4700, including Paypal (so all of our assets). We
have 19 paying members currently. As Don stated, we are far under and we
may need to up the membership dues, even though they are already high.
Dues alone only pay for half of our expenses. Once we pay June and May
rent, we will have \$1440 in our account. Karen notes that weâ€™ve asked
Mike about an easement on rent payments, and we are not seeing donations
from people who would normally visit the space so the coronavirus is
impacting our cash flow. We also may still have \$1500 in Facebook
waiting to be transferred in donations, and there may be funds available
for non-profits impacted by the shelter-in-place order.
