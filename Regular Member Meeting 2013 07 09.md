We had a surplus so I am able to declare a \$250 Project Awesome
dividend and add \$113.49 to our reserves. Here is the Project Awesome

### Project LASER {#project_laser}

Dan: Showed proof that the laser has cut something.. test pattern on
plexiglas. All seems to work. Needs to be be placed in a cabinet. Will
be working most evenings this week at the space setting things up. **Do
not use the laser without being cleared by Dan for saftey!**

### Project BYZANTIUM {#project_byzantium}

Some updates, including adding Groundstation (software). Organizing
repositories. Starting 4th milestone.. lots to do, heading towards a
beta quality release.

### Project KITBUILD {#project_kitbuild}

\[Alberto:\] Tim S has been reimbursed \[treasurer@, please
confirm/deny?\] for soldering irons and other Project Kitbuild supplies
he had ordered. The first Kitbuild will take place next week, July 16,
at the 1st of 4 sessions of HacDC Summer School 2013. The boxes with the
soldering goodies have been taking up valuable space in the shop for a
few weeks. I have been unable to get to the space to do anything and
apologize for that clutter. I'm recruiting helpers to move it out of
there to a better storage location and would appreciate guidance on
where best to store the stuff.

Discussion: things are ok where they are for now.. we need to get rid of
more stuff in general around the space.

### Project SUPPLIES {#project_supplies}

No expenditures this month. Ongoing equipment setup and cleanup has been
a priority. Also, we have many semi-sorted components (resistors and
similar) taking up several boxes. Consolidating these into a mini-rack
would be useful and save space.

### Project SPACECAM {#project_spacecam}

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

### mirage335

#### Imagnus

-   NDA will be narrowly limited in scope, and not apply to HacDC
    members who do not sign.
-   So far, we have informally agreed to a mockup CAD model within about
    a week, and a complete technology demonstration in about a month.
    These goals are easily feasible.

### alberto

For the next four Tuesdays, we will host workshops (publicized as *HacDC
Summer School 2013*) providing an introduction to physical computing
with Arduino, Danger Shield, and Processing. As noted above, the first
of these will be a kitbuild for the Danger Shield. The class filled up
instantly and I increased seats from the original 10 to 16.

I'm sure we could bring a lot of new people into the space with similar
offerings. It may be a good idea to try to design a series with a big
arc so that folks stay engaged on a broad topic but can get value from
attending just one workshop. One addition which would dovetail nicely as
a run-up to these 4 sessions would be an Intro to Electronics, and a
series which might fit nicely as a follow up would be one on AVR
programming. I want to thank Katie, Martin, Phil, Shawn and Chris for
offering to help out, especially during the first one.

### David Mc {#david_mc}

Starting planning for 3DP build run.
[3DP_Build_Run_2013.07](3DP_Build_Run_2013.07) Would like to
go with Kossel Pro, but Kossel Mini seems more likely.

### Dan Barlow {#dan_barlow}

Thanks to Chas, Martin, and TC for helping with wrestling the optical
table into the basement. New shelves and cabinet were donated.

### Hax

'Data center' issues with overheating and lack of ventilation. Working
on plan for updating and organizing the hardware there.

## Old Business {#old_business}

## New Business {#new_business}

### Dehumidifier

Several have expressed desire for a dehumidifier in the basement. Has
been talked about on the member's list. Discussion is leaning towards
buying a AC/dehumid unit from Sears as per Dan B.'s suggestion.

-   Ben proposed allowing a \$500 expenditure by Katie for a unit picked
    out by Dan B.

    :   Approved by member vote.
