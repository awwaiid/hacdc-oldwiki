Borrowed an LCD screen for use as an additional monitor at home. I took
one LCD screen (that had VGA inputs) and replaced it with another LCD
screen (quite similar to the one I took, but possibly lower in quality)
(as this one had HDMI inputs - that my PC can't handle.). I have also
brought an additional small monitor to the space (March 2018). \[Could
some let me know if this suffices?\]

Biosignal amplifier was returned a long time ago, hopefully it will be
treated well. Non-flyable quadcopter, legos, high-power audio amps were
also returned long ago, though the seem not to be in the space at
present. Also, have been borrowing stick welder, both in hopes of
testing it, and to keep it out of the way of basement cleanup projects.
Need for high-current 240V service has held up that project.

Borrowed a Dell D620 to put GNU/Hurd on it because it seemed like a good
use for it. Maybe we can use it for an experimental OS development
project?

Temporarily storing a bunch of stuff from HacDC, to relieve some of the
temporary storage pressure during the move. Most prominently,our
biosignal amplifier, a bunch of high-power audio amps, a couple
non-flyable quadcopters, a RC hovercraft toy, a telescope, some more
legos, some toy night-vision goggles, the NI myDAQ/myDSP, and some IP
cams. Will return upon request, hopefully sooner. Hopefully most of this
stuff (ie. biosignal amplifier audio amps, IP cams, myDAQ/myDSP, etc)
will be immediately integrated into the new classroom soon after the
move. EDIT: NI myDAQ/myDSP returned along time ago. Returned the
telescope, night-vision goggles, and IP cams.

Returned label printer, which is not useful without a special adapter
cable among other things. Borrowed a bag of legos and empty microscope
head for optical prototyping and photolithography experiments. Most
Legos will probably be returning after replacement by 3D printed parts.
Will return upon request.

Returned remaining screwdrivers and such. Borrowed an average
oscilloscope, and low-end function generator long term, will return upon
request or when tolerance for their existance at the space improves (eg.
for a class event). Also borrowed one of the several wire-wrapping tools
recent discovered.

USRP, related radio gear (some of which was built by me), wire,
low-quality soldering iron, 2.4GHz R/C transmitter/receiver pair.
Attempting to set up ham radio antenna at new QTH. Additionally, going
to try repairing a model R/C plane with the R/C transmitter/receiver
pair. Will return unused radio gear and supplies to HacDC when done, and
donate for anything used. EDIT: Have returned some of the supplies as of
3/28/2014. Still borrowing USRP and soldering iron. RC plane may be able
to use R/C transmitter/receiver pair if given new servomotors. Also
borrowed a pair of decent pilers and wire cutters. EDIT: Borrowed SMT
tweezers as of 4/14/2014, since my own set may not be adequate for an
urgent project. Also borrowed M3 screwdriver bit. EDIT: Also borrowed
soldering iron tip, while waiting on RMA from two other tips. Will
probably bring back with some of the other materials within a week or
two, time-ultra-critical project still underway. EDIT: Have returned
almost everything. Still occasionally borrowing a few screwdrivers and
other non-critical items, as some of my own have failed.

Project Salvage components. Most should become valuable electronic test
equipment at HacDC and absolutely must not be trashed. EDIT: Returned a

still progressing.

`<s>`{=html}Borrowing Ham radio gear tomorrow. Specifically, IC-718
radio, antenna tuner, RF power meter, balun (if available), PSU, some
feedline, some wire, and a measuring tape (if \>12'). Will also borrow
some of my own objects at the space, specifically a UPS (for its 12V
battery) and a magnetic loop antenna. Leaving my name and number on the
ham radio cart in case anyone needs the radio or has questions. This is
exclusively for the purpose of diagnosing HacDC's ham radio issues as
documented on the mailing list.`</s>`{=html} Postponed due to severe
weather and power disruption. Radio not borrowed yet.

- Ancient (20 years+) semi-working AM/FM/WB/CB radio. Found in basement.
AM function never worked, in sorry shape, needs repair, so I'm going to
try repairing it as far as possible. Will be back at the space in \~2
weeks. EDIT: Returned. After mostly mechanical repairs, AM, FM, CB
functions work well.

'cause, you know, all the cool kids were doing it.\
I discovered that the unit I borrowed is flaky - after a few seconds of
wearing it while powered up the display flickers and goes dead. I think
that the cable leading from the power pack to the visor has a bad
connection. When I get time I'll tear this one down and see if I can
repair it.\
