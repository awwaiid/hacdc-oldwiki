[Q](User:Q), giving us a couple of RFID chips that we'd like
to hook up to antennae and eventually integrate into something
wearableâ€”perhaps a patch or cuff. According to our understanding, the
SmarTrip card is an [ISO/IEC 14443 Type B
card](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2056.pdf)
that has a 13.56 MHz operating frequency, 10 cm operating distance
(under optimal circumstances), and 106 kbps data transmission rate.
[This antenna matching-circuit calculation (link not

13.56 MHz RFID systems and antennas design
guide](http://www.melexis.com/prodfiles/0003929_AN90121_7.pdf) may prove
useful.

I wonder if you could work one of those RFID chips into a ring or a
cufflink... --The Doctor

in Westchester, IL sells a few 13.56MHz RFID Tags that might be useful
to dissect and or transplant into. Very similar to a cufflink. I've
ordered a few and will see how it works. Right now the Antenna design is
the hardest part. How do you get enough power to the chip from an adhoc
antenna? [rich](User:Wonderfullyrich)
