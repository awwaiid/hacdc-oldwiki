## Member Reports {#member_reports}

-   the Lulzbot Mini is once again extruding NinjaFlex rubber but the
    PLA parts that hold the extruder assembly in place are cracking...
    Possibilities include downloading and reprinting those parts or
    retiring the rubber, and returning to the PLA extruder assembly.

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff) {#director_reports_governance_related_stuff}

### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

PP + BB&T reserves are currently at \$2388 + \$388 = \$2776 We currently
have \~\$2500 incoming from a combination of Giving Tuesday funds and
James' fundraiser from Facebook

So current total is \~\$5000 dollars.

Expenses: \$1629 (rent) + \$41 (insurance) = \$1670/month Income: \$1237

Burn rate: \$433/month

This leaves us with approximately 11 months until we run out of funds.
Given our current planning to find some additional funding, I'm
optimistic about us closing this gap in the next few months. This will
take finding additional members, letting know visitors to the space know
that we are looking for donations, and other visions forthcoming.
