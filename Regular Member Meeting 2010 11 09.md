## Old Business

## New Business

### Make: Magazine Gift Subscriptions

Motion: To develop a HacDC 3D-printable trinket or gift and a holiday
card to give to people who would like to buy Make: Magazine
subscriptions through our Make:Money program.

Seconded by:

Background: At least one member has already expressed an interest in
buying gift subscriptions. Subscriptions won't begin until after the
holidays, so creating a trinket and card would allow the giver to have
something to present to the person they bought the magazine for.
Subscriptions cost \$34.95. HacDC keeps half of that amount for each
subscription.

Discussion:

-   Nothing in this requires a vote.

### FIRST Robotics Team Mentorship

Motion: To approve an organization-wide mentorship of a local FIRST
robotics team.

Seconded by:

Background: FIRST Robotics representatives have asked HacDC to sponsor
(non-monetarily), a local DC team. HacDC would "adopt" a team, and
individual members would meet with the team at their high school, the
HacDC space, or other locations, to help them prepare for the FIRST
Robotics competition. HacDC members with varying expertise would be
needed.

-   Nothing in this requires a vote.

### Motion to restrict communication with landlords

Motion: To authorize the HacDC board of directors to carry out ALL
business and communication with the landlord AND all personnel employed
by the landlord. And, to restrict all other members from ANY discussions
involving HacDC, HacDC business, or other HacDC members with the
landlord.

Seconded:

Background: Recently, member(s) of HacDC who believe it is their role to
speak on HacDC's behalf with our landlords have been communicating
information about HacDC that paint it in a negative light, without any
logical reason for doing so. There have also been discussions with
church personnel which include private details about members of HacDC.
These conversations, whether carried out in good conscience, harm
HacDC's relationship with our landlord and also harm the reputation of
individual HacDC members who's reputations have been besmirched.

-   tabled
