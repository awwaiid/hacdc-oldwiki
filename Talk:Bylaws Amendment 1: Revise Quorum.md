I'd like to request clarification on what "encourages continued
participation through other means" (listed as a Pro under the first
option) means. What are "other means"? [Katie](User:Katie)

It seems to me that "The simplest solution, keeping the space as active
as possible" listed as Pros under the first option are more like
conclusions than arguments. (That said, I would agree that "simple" is a
valid Pro argument.) [Katie](User:Katie) 15:06, 9 July 2008

:   I reformatted and expanded on the arguments I originally put down.
    Did my changes address most of these concerns?

    :   It's not clear to me how "Encourages discussions to happen in an
        ongoing manner through the wiki, mailing list, and other means"
        is a Pro particular to the first option rather than applying to
        all three (or to none?). --[Katie](User:Katie) 19:32,

Observation: the third option is kind of self-deselecting, isn't it? The
members who are least able to attend physically for the vote are the
ones who would presumably be most likely to vote for it, you know?

:   Very True. The points I'd like to add to that are:
:   \* This, like all proposals, are discussed virtually. So far, most
    of the people not attending physically have not really been
    participating virtually, either. Do we change that, and if so, how?
:   \* After the Bylaws meeting, It's actually quite rare to see a
    policy discussion take place at a meeting. Most of that discussion,
    if it happens, happens on the list or the wiki page.
:   \* It would be difficult for people to implement a virtual meeting
    policy, given they have to dedicate time to meet in person to change
    it. (Catch-22, I know...)

I'd like to register my disagreement with a couple of the "Cons" listed
under the virtual meeting option:

-   Very high barriers in terms of functionality, usability, resource
    drain, etc.
-   Encourages "voting" as opposed to informed consensus building

This hasn't been my experience of virtual meeting participation at all.
