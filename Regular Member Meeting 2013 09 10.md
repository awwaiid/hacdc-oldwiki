to.

## Director Reports {#director_reports}

### President's Report {#presidents_report}

ISC Grant is completed. See Project Byzantium report.

Silver Spring Mini Maker Faire is coming up. Please plan to attend and
show off what you're working on.

Speaking of Faires, it's Renn Fest season.

What's going on with the Crypto Party? Can we get that on the calendar
and start promoting?

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for August 2013:
![](HacDC_Financials_2013_08.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2013_08.pdf"). We
gained Ann Millspaugh, Evan Phillips, Jarett DeAngelis, Kay Kenworthy,
Brendan Levy, as new, paying members. No members left, though one will
be on hiatus until January.

#### Project Awesome {#project_awesome}

Thanks to fewer delinquent members and an unexpected grant from the
Community Foundation for Northern Virginia, we had a healthy surplus
this month, so I am declaring a \$1000 Project Awesome dividend, which
leaves us with \$1,481.74 to add to our unearmarked reserves. Here is
the Project Awesome spreadsheet for August:
![](HacDC_PA_Projects-2013_08.pdf "HacDC_PA_Projects-2013_08.pdf").
There are currently 15 votes.

### Project BYZANTIUM {#project_byzantium}

Grant is finished.

### Project KITBUILD {#project_kitbuild}

No report.

### Project SUPPLIES {#project_supplies}

#### Arrivals

##### IGBTs

-   Credit to Dan Barlow, \$300 parts obtained for \$18, amazing find!
-   600V, 200A, \~1MHz switching speed.
-   Stored in blue bucket on parts store shelves. Recommended donation
    of at least \$100, prefer to see them used in equipment available to
    HacDC members.

##### PLA Solvent (Tetrahydrofuran) {#pla_solvent_tetrahydrofuran}

-   Manually polish or glue PLA printed parts with just few drops.
-   Small glass bottle, stored inside metal tin on chemical shelf.
-   Generally safe as acetone. However, seal tight to minimize
    oxidization, and wear nitrile gloves.

##### Solder Paste {#solder_paste}

-   Professional quality SMT soldering by the thousand. Recommend laser
    cutting blue tape for stencils and hot air gun for soldering. See
    <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyDRHI4YeMI> .
-   Stored in fridge, ideally at 10C, for vastly extended shelf life.
    Not food.
-   Toxic, like all solder dust. Minimize contamination, wash hands
    thoroughly after use.

##### PCB Milling Bit {#pcb_milling_bit}

-   Maximum quality circuit boards, 5 mil diameter.
-   Stored in toolbox.
-   Tough when spinning, fragile when not.

#### Future Plans {#future_plans}

-   Spare hot-end for Prusa Mendel.
-   Large plastic buckets.

### Project SPACECAM {#project_spacecam}

Still figuring things out including possible bandwidth issues and
addressing privacy concerns. He's planning to start working on
infrastructure while trying to figure out how to take care of the other
issues.

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

### [User:haxwithaxe](User:haxwithaxe)

-   antennas
-   marine corp marathon
-   DSO Nano v3 fail
-   DIY laptop - core components are in

### mirage335

Hope my reports aren't getting too long...

#### General Use Computer {#general_use_computer}

New computer in front room set up for general web browsing, google
hangout hosting, etc.

#### Biohacking

##### Imagnus

Still going well, still plan to give details later.

##### Biosignal Amplifier {#biosignal_amplifier}

New headgear tested, using earplug "sponges" instead of pin headers.
Comfortable, works well, even through thick hair.

#### Shelves

Would like to have more shelves at HacDC. We are now accumulating
considerable quantities of non-junk on floors, such as:

-   Working computers, monitors, photo frames networking gear, WiFi
    antennas, etc.
-   Stationery, CDs, floppies.
-   Books.
-   Laser/Mill stock.
-   Microscopes, lasers, lenses, slides, etc.
-   Audio gear.
-   Radios.

#### Projector/OpenDisplay

##### **Giant Fresnel Lenses - Craiglist Expedition for Rear Projection TV** {#giant_fresnel_lenses___craiglist_expedition_for_rear_projection_tv}

<http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/search/zip?query=projection&zoomToPosting=&srchType=A&minAsk=&maxAsk=>

**Calling any volunteers to pick up five of these, and deliver them to
HacDC for tear-down.**

Rear projection TVs, available freely on Craigslist, are now the only
known source of the five Fresnel lenses we require. Project is stalled
until we get these lenses.

##### Final Cost Estimate {#final_cost_estimate}

\$128.97 Includes metal-halide light source, projection lens, and
condenser lenses. Does not include LCD (which we probably have) or
Fresnel lenses (which we probably can't buy).

##### Design/OpenSource

Optical experiments and design complete. Published, with CAD models, as
OpenDisplay.
