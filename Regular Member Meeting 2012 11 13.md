### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

The Project Byzantium team spent last weekend in the Red Hook
neighborhood of Brooklyn working with the Red Hook Initiative to roll
out a mesh network and deliver Internet access to public parks and the
the public housing buildings, many of which are still without power.
Read about it here:

The Elements of Computing Systems is starting back up, class tomorrow on
Machine Language. Sign up on Meetup.
<http://www.meetup.com/hac-dc/events/90687312/>

We have applied for a FEMA grant along with OTI, MtPCWN, CHCWN, and the
Mount Pleasant Solar Co-op to develop a disaster-resilient mesh network
that will provide communication and services in the event of an
emergency which disrupts traditional infrastructure (similar to what RHI
is doing in Brooklyn).

Project Byzantium attended IS4CWN in Barcelona and built connections
with other community wireless and mesh networking teams and experts from
around the globe.

The Broadband Bridge is in the planning stages of forming a Co-op ISP
that would be able to re-sell the DC-CAN fiber network at more
reasonable pricing. We may finally be able to get Internet that doesn't
suck at St. Stephens.

While I was away I visited HacMan, Manchester's Hackerspace. It was
surprisingly familiar. Pictures here:

One picture is a sign they posted titled "Clean Bench Policy". It reads,
"Clean Bench Policy: Non-tool items left on this bench will be either
put into the teardown boxes or binned. / If you want to keep something,
this is a bad place to leave it! / Let's all work together to keep this
area tidy." I thought that was an idea worth fork()-ing.

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

Here is the financial summary spreadsheet for October 2012:
![](HacDC_Financials_2012_10.pdf "HacDC_Financials_2012_10.pdf") We had
one member join (Robert King), and two members are being dropped because
of not paying dues or responding to emails (Alan McCosh and Lawrence
Scott). After a flurry of emails, non-paying members are down from eight
to four - thanks to everyone that paid up their back dues!

Quroum remains at 14.

We had a bunch of one-time donations in October which resulted in a
surplus: \$300 from Shana Kim, \$200 from the family Christina
Kalavritinos in memory of self-taught maker Ralph Ochsman, \$100 from
Christine Prefontaine (earmarked for Byzantium), donations to cover
missed dues payments, and a wad of cash from the tip jar that had piled
up in between trips to the bank (including about \$100 from the
Raspberry Pi workshop). As a result we had a \$1558 surplus over
expenses!

#### Project Awesome {#project_awesome}

Because of the large one-time donations, I am able to declare a \$1000
Project Awesome dividend for October 2012. We could give up to \$1300
this month and still add \$150 to the reserve, but I wanted to spread
out the dividend and dedicate \$300 of this month's surplus for
November's projects. Since only one project had been proposed as of Oct
31st - Project LASER - it got 100% of the votes and money for October.

I am disappointed that more projects haven't been proposed, but maybe
this amount will get peoples' attention - if you had proposed and voted
for your project you'd have at least \$250 to spend on it. I don't know
of any similar donations in the coming months but like the lottery, you
can't win if you don't play.

Here is the spreadsheet I'm using to track Project Awesome funding:
![](HacDC_PA_Projects-2012_10.pdf "HacDC_PA_Projects-2012_10.pdf").

### Secretary

Planning to improve website. Add clearer directions/guidance for guests
and new members. Add Tools page which highlights and describes tools
available at the space. Also planning to improve entry-way - organize
and clean up. Possibly remove workstation.

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}

#### Martin

We got our ARRL affiliation and we now show up on the ARRL website when
people search this area. November 28th the DC Amateur Radio Emergency
Services Coordinator will be presenting at HARC.

#### Andy

We need to locate the DC Maker Unfaire! Suspect it was target of a CoD..

## Project Awesome Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project LASER {#project_laser}

Money building up (\$2500 now earmarked) but still shy of \>\$4000 for
the larger FSLaser 40W model. Should we try to raise money or just wait
for more PA funds? Found a less expensive water cooler option at Rabbit
Laser, avoids mess of tank under laser table:
<http://www.rabbitlaserusa.com/WebShop/Chillers.html> This uses a heat
exchanger and fan to bring the cooling water down to room temperature,
but maybe we can put it in front of a window A/C unit to get active
cooling. --TimS
