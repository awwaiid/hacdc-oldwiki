## Website Feedback

Please update this page with details of any broken links, errors or
requested content

A quick scan using linkchecker (http://linkchecker.sourceforge.net)
identified hundreds of bad links. Most of them were due to the wordpress
permalink configuration problem that will be addressed on the new
server.

Broken permalinks are the key problem for the Wordpress installation.
Putting in a vote for keeping the "archive" content when we change
servers - is it possible?

TC - We should be able to export the existing Wordpress data and load it
on the new server
