## New Members {#new_members}

## Old Business {#old_business}

-   Food Kitchen -- Karen has been there, group volunteering possible.
    Likely in two weeks Saturday morning (9am-12pm) -- Update: No spots
    available for Saturday until August, have inquired directly to find
    other ways to help if necessary

-   Karen -- Talked to Tristan, thought he could do CTF online,
    interested in doing a different game from the website to change it
    up. He was ready to go Karen suggested that we should do a test
    first. Tristan could use someone to help with the admin
    (Meetup/promotion) and the help during the event. Gabe volunteers to
    do one in the next two weeks sometime (21st/22nd of May?)

-   Tayeb -- Monthly Sentiment Survey results discussion -- will request
    that members be vaccinated before coming to the space -- Updated
    guidelines sent to board for discussion at this meeting

```{=html}

```
-   Tayeb -- First HacDC in-person/hybrid event to be scheduled for next
    Monday -- Proposed guidelines for space usage are as follows:

`   -- Masks are required within the church common spaces and the HacDC space`\
`   -- We expect that you are vaccinated if you visit the space`\
`   -- Ensure the AC units in the window are running to ensure better ventilation`\
`   -- We are keeping a 5 person limit for events for now`

One idea that I discussed was the purchase of an air purifier for the
space -- there is evidence that a HEPA filter can catch covid. This may
not be fully necessary for covid-safety, but it seemed like an idea with
other great positive externalities like reducing VOCs from soldering and
ventilating the space better. Links:

Our ongoing plan with the church for reduced rent during Covid is coming
to an end. After discussing with Mike, we will be stepping the rent back
up now that 10 or more individuals are allowed in the physical space.
The rent will be stepped up in July and then September again.
