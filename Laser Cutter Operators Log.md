-   18 Oct 2013: [User: rob](User:_rob) experimented with
    engraving some black-and-white images on acrylic and cut some
    acrylic for a project. The Full Spectrum LLC print driver just gave
    me error messages and I couldn't figure out the problem, so I just
    converted my images to BMP and that worked fine. It may be of
    interest that I have found that cutting 0.177" thick acrylic
    reliably takes 10-11 passes at 100% power, 100% speed. 10 passes
    leaves some small chads at the edges that are brushed off pretty
    easily; 11 generally cuts it clean.

-   [User:Haxwithaxe](User:Haxwithaxe) made acrylic PentaGo
    board parts. [design](https://github.com/haxwithaxe/pentago-flat). i
    forgot to record the time used.
    -   i used some of the red plastic that was next to the table and it
        made sort of a cotton candy like material when lased so we might
        want to figure out what it is exactly.
