My wiki foo is not sufficient nor do I care enough right now to undo the
feature that is putting dashed line boxes around parts of the code.
Ignore the weird typesetting and just copy and paste from here into your
cad of choice. The position of the HAC letters is tweeked by eye to get
the H and C to line up with the D and C below them. Letter size is also
reduced by 90% by eye to create an offset from the edge which matches
the logo offset nicely.

08:42, 25 March 2017 (PDT) My wikifoo has improved greatly. I'm creating
a page for the cheap Chinese laser. I fixed the formatting on the
Openscad code here, too.
