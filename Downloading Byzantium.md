\`\*Fitness is a score from 0 to 5 indicating the fitness of a release
for use as an **Emergency** networking aid. Do not let this put you off
downloading it to try it out or help us by finding and reporting bug and
feature requests. In order to make it to a level 5 fitness we need as
many people to use it as possible so we are more likely to find bugs
before they end up causing trouble for people who expect our livedistro
to work in an emergency.

-   0 = completely unfit (likely to do more harm than good in any
    emergency)
-   1 = still mostly unfit (unless you are an active developer on the
    project you won't likely benefit from this in an emergency)
-   2 = works well enough to provide basic connectivity with minimal
    configuration. (yeh! we're a little bit fit now! which is not to say
    we're fit enough to run a marathon, so don't expect to be able to do
    much without a regular internet connection or some sysadmin skills)
-   3 = in addition to qualifying for level 2 fitness this has basic
    intermesh services like a built in chat server, microblog server and
    similar user oriented services ready to run with minimal
    configuration. (still needs a service to tell other mesh users and
    end users about the services on the mesh, aka our DNSless service
    distribution).
-   4 = fully featured and works well enough to be used in friendly
    network conditions (you aren't in jeopardy of getting
    arrested/attacked for using it for things that are considered legal
    where you are using it)
-   5 = fully featured and setup with best effort secure defaults and
    possibly other security features (this by no means should suggest
    that it is safe to use in an environment where there is a government
    or government like entity is actively trying to suppress network
    connectivity by means other than denial standard network
    connectivity)
-   6 = if we find the magic sauce that can make it super hard to find
    users if you aren't a user and reasonably impossible to detect or
    decrypt traffic not sent to you, then you will see this magic number
    as the fitness score. Until then it is the metaphorical unicorn. It
    doesn't exist.

You may have noticed that the fitness list doesn't ever say it's safe to
use in a hostile network. That's because it won't likely ever be safe to
use in a hostile network. The best we can do is to set reasonably secure
defaults and policies and try to educate users on internet hygiene so
they don't let people rub malware in their face if they go someplace we
can't protect them.
