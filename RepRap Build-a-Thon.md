## Press Release

    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

    Local Technology and Arts Collective Holding Weekend Seminar on
    Self-Replicating Tools

    Washington, DC – January  24-25, 2009.   HacDC the Washington, DC-area
    technology and arts collective, is presenting a free, open to the
    public two-day event over the weekend of January 24th – 25th.
    Attendees will participate in the construction and use of a remarkable
    open source tool, the "Replicating Rapid Prototyper" or RepRap.
    Anyone can make a RepRap machine, using parts made by another person
    with a similar machine, and a few additional parts that can be found
    online or from a local hardware store.  RepRap is capable of making a
    nearly complete copy of itself, given a small amount of (possibly
    recycled) plastic.  Once the machine is made, the user can download
    designs for other objects from the Internet or create their own
    designs, which can then be printed with the RepRap machine.

    The two-day sessions will include talks by RepRap founders and
    pioneers, as well as demonstrations by local experimenters who have
    built their own RepRaps and contributed to the development of the
    system.   After the talks, the seminar participants will participate
    in the construction of a RepRap from the ground up.  Attendees will
    complete this process  during the seminar, providing a great
    opportunity for everyone to get some experience assembling and using a
    RepRap.  Smaller breakout sessions on related topics, such as stepper
    motor function, microcontroller programming and 3D modeling will be
    presented, in order to provide the attendees with the skills needed to
    construct and use the RepRap system.

    The event will take place at HacDC's headquarters at 1525 Newton St.
    in NW Washington, DC.  The events will start at 10:00am on Saturday,
    January 24 and end on Sunday the 25th at 3:00pm.  For more
    information, see the HacDC website at:
    http://hacdc.org/2008/12/11/reprap-build-a-thon/.

    The process of "desktop manufacturing" is coming of age- like the
    personal computer in the 1970s, such systems are either very
    expensive, or the purview of a few hobbyists in their garages.  But
    like the personal computer before it, the desktop manufacturing
    revolution is breaking out.  The RepRap, like other open-source
    projects such as the Linux operating system and the Firefox browser,
    is allowing anyone with the patience and interest to participate.
    HacDC and other organizations throughout the world want to see that
    this technology can be widely understood and utilized by the public.
    As a result, HacDC (along with other area technology groups such as
    B/WRUG, Make:DC and DC Dorkbot) are presenting this event, and making
    it free and open to the public.



    ABOUT RepRap

    The RepRap Project is an initiative aimed at creating a largely
    self-replicating machine which can be used for rapid prototyping and
    manufacturing. A rapid prototyper is a 3D printer that is able to
    fabricate three dimensional artifacts from a computer-based model.

    Project authors describe 'self-replication', understood as the ability
    to reproduce the components necessary to build another version of
    itself, as one of the goals for the project.  This will allow the
    number of RepRaps to increase exponentially to meet demand. The
    authors further speculate that, due to the Open Source nature of the
    project, RepRap will eventually demonstrate evolution, improving and
    increasing its capabilities over time. This gives RepRap the potential
    to become a powerful disruptive technology, similar to the Internet,
    the home computer, and the automobile.  For more information, see the
    RepRap website at: http://www.reprap.org

## Concept

Join the HacDC and and the Baltimore/Maryland RepRap User’s Group (RUG)
for a weekend of RepRap fun! Save the weekend of January 24/25 for our
RepRap Build-a-Thon. Initial plans include a range of activities,
including hands-on group construction a RepRap Darwin from the ground up
starting with laser-cut acrylic parts. We are also planning on having
several local RepRap builders on hand with their machines, and hopefully
able to demonstrate them in operation, making stuff!

We would also like to invite some of the local technology
media/blogosphere folks, and take the opportunity to not only
demonstrate what these machines can do, but also to talk in general
about the implications of readily-available (and self-replicating) rapid
prototyping machines. Certainly a great opportunity to chat with some
RepRap pioneers, have a chance to participate in a hands-on build, and
to generally have a good time with some local hackers.

More information coming as the plans develop- watch this space! If you
are interested in helping out, please let us know via the mailing list.
If you have contacts in the local technology media, or know someone in
the trade who would be interested in this kind of event, please let us
know! See the movie post below for a time-compressed version of RepRap
construction by one of the original designers- the time represented by
the video is about four hours. Given enough participants, we should be
able to do something similar in our two days!

## Project Plan

In order to get this project under way, it will be important to have a
schedule that is workable, given that we have a month and a half or so
to plan and execute the event. Thanks to Nick for this first cut at what
needs to be done. Over the following week or so, we will identify folks
to take these action items and give them a due date.

0\) Ensure the venue is sufficient

1\) Solidify the schedule for the event:

-   We have the Auditorium from 08:00 Saturday Morning to roughly 09:00
    Sunday Morning
-   Due to church activities, we'll have to shift quietly into the HacDC
    space or our Workshop until roughly 13:00 Sunday afternoon, when we
    move down to the Dining Room.
-   Then we have the Dining Room until Monday morning.
-   Do we need to schedule time on Friday night?
-   Are we going to have classes, mini events, talks, etc? If so, what?
    We should try to make the event something that people can come check
    out for an hour, as well as have specific talks, classes, events,
    demos that people need to be there for at a specific time.
    (Otherwise, some people might not show up!)

2\) Solidify the budget

-   This event should be free and open to the public, like all HacDC
    events
-   What are we going to realistically need/want to provide? Food? A
    machine for HacDC? Etc.

3\) Publicity/Future

-   How frequently do we want to blog about it on hacdc.org, possibly
    cross-promote on nycresistor.com, or other sites? Thingiverse?
-   When do we want to really start hitting make, etc.
-   What are we calling the event? Are we committing to doing something
    like this annually? Quarterly?
