# Status

Non-functional. Printer is electromechanically in working order, but is
reporting minor problems, such as clogged nozzles. Marginal success has
been seen depositing magenta and cyan ink during built-in test routines.

# History

Was donated in near-new condition, needing only a new ink cartridge.
However, more pressing concerns delayed us setting it up for a few
years. Recently, we have replaced the ink cartridge, and attempted
printing.

# Issues

## DryInkjets

Prolonged disuse is presumed to have resulted in inkjet heads having
dried up.

Ultrasonic cleaning may be a solution.
