HacDC has lots of stuff. More stuff is always coming in. HacDC has a
limited amount of space. Some stuff has to [go
out](Resource_Disposal).

The trick is to save what's most useful, and to be able to find it when
you need it. What follows is an organizational scheme that's worked well
in my ([Myself/Nate](User:Myself)) life, and I think it'll
apply here since the types of stuff are nearly identical.

There are a few basic rules:

-   Label everything.
-   If a label isn't clear, rewrite it.
-   When a box fills up, either:
    -   Split it into subcategories and label them.
    -   Purge some stuff from the box.
    -   Move it into a larger box.

Simply put: A place for everything, and everything in its place.

Store](Components_Store), [Resource
Disposal](Resource_Disposal)

Without further ado, here are the categories and subcategories that've
worked for keeping a massive pile of stuff under control:
