We've had two rounds of the AVR Microcontroller class at HacDC so far.

-   If you're looking to learn, see the 2011 class. [AVR Microcontroller
    Class 2011](AVR_Microcontroller_Class_2011) (happened in
    Feb/March 2011)

-   If you're looking for specific old materials, we're keeping that
    online too! [AVR Microcontroller Class
    2009](AVR_Microcontroller_Class_2009) (the first run of
    the class)
