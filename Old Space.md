This page refers to the space HacDC rented from 2010 to 2015 and is
currently out of date; we have moved to suite 212.

## Current Space Plan

This is based on all meetings to date including the space planning
meeting on 6/4 and the shop planning meeting on 6/14. Please leave
feedback on the wiki, or on the members list. Thanks!

### Meeting Room

-   36" kitchen counter height 24" deep "bar tables" around the meeting
    room perimeter, except in front of windows and part of the room for
    sofa/library shelves
-   8-12" shelf above all "bar table" surface for people's stuff - will
    normally remain uncluttered. lighting mounted underneat, as well as
    power strips.
-   bar stools or other adjustable seating around "bar table" permiter,
    so they can be stored underneath table surface
-   white board between radiator and wall (the wall with no windows) -
    should be room for about 6' of whiteboard
-   low 10-18" bookshelves below the windows and whiteboard
-   comfortable seating/sofa in back of room against far wall
    (windowless wall)
-   book shelves mounted above comortable seating or next to it for
    library (library area)
-   upper wall space free for framed art, dampening panels, exhibit du
    jour (rotating museum?, murals?)
-   projector mounted facing window across from door, pull down screen
    (that Jamie donated)
-   large tables in center of room, either two large ones or some
    smaller folding ones for more flexibility
-   total accomodations without removing tables is about 20-25, 30-35
    with tables removed
-   Member storage could be in low bookcases in plastic containers
    (should be at least 40 cubic feet, so everyone can have a box at
    least as big as our current lockers)
-   If necessary we can add more storage under some of the bar tables,
    though it might block some leg room

### Upstairs Workshop

At the meeting last night (6/14) we roughly agreed on the following
(please correct errors/omissions):

-   The half of the room with the windows will be for fixed tables and
    storage above, maybe based on Martin's design for the bench. Details
    TBD. The fixed spaces will have items stored that relate to the use
    of the space under them (testing equip above electronics area for
    example).
-   The other half will be folding tables that can be re-arranged for
    flexible uses - classes, projects requiring table space,
    flexi-workspaces, etc.
-   The floor under the workshop should be protected - materials TBD.
-   We'll draw up plans and do a bill of materials and present the costs
    and diagrams/renderings to the group on the list before we start
    building it out
-   For fixed tables, standard laboratory tables were suggested, but it
    wasn't clear what depth table tops to use - 24" was considered
    probably too shallow, so 30"+ was desired. With diagrams of
    configurations it will be a little clearer.
-   The 2 black shelves in the workshop could be used as under-counter
    storage for the meeting room/saloon
-   The lockers will be moved out of the workshop, most likely -
    possibly into the meeting room, unless we use an alternative form of
    member storage (bins on shelves for example)
-   Cross-brace/bridge across the shelving on either side of the window
    side of the room. It would support the projector and any other
    ceiling-mounted gear.

### Basement / Wood shop

-   layout unknown - use is half wood working and half stock/long term
    storage
-   equipment: heavy duty table saw, router, vacuum system, etc
-   should accomodate 3-4 people working at most

### Kitchen

-   Corner or L shelves in kitchen where paper towel dispenser is. Move
    dispenser between bathroom doors and use shelves for kitchen,
    cleaning, bathroom supply storage including dishes.

See image gallery for sketches and renderings. Meeting room sketchup
rendering is still roughly what was discussed - workshop 2D diagram is
out of date based on shop meeting on 6/14.

## Move

Move-out date for old space is Monday June 7 2010. Certain days and
times are not open for heavy moving due to noise concerns:

-   Sat June 5th and Mon June 7th from 8pm and also June 5th from
    3pm-5pm: live recording of a staged reading of The Merchant of
    Venice will be taking place in the auditorium
-   Sundays during services (8-9 a.m., 10:30-11:45 a.m., 5-6 p.m.)

Next planning meeting is Tuesday 6/1 at 7pm. All members are encouraged
to attend so everyone can help make the new space awesome.

## Dan Barlow's suggestions

Permanent space allocation for tool installations (hardware room)

1.  RepRap needs about a cubic yard, away from air conditioning,
    preferably out of the way of being bumped.
2.  Soldering Station (Martin's Masterpiece) needs about 8? feet by 3
    feet.
3.  Drill Press
4.  Mill Station; needs about a cubic yard
5.  Laser Station; needs to be near a window for ventilation (for future
    laser cutter)
6.  Printer Tower; I imagine a wire rack shelf (we can use mine from the
    basement) with the B/W and color laser printers, a scanner, the
    lamination tool box, and a computer to run it all.
7.  Signal Station; I imagine PC based analyzer/scope/bus pirate/??? all
    set up as a permanent workstation

Permanent multimedia allocation for presentations (meeting/programming
room)

1.  Speakers installed near ceiling in corners
2.  Projector installed on ceiling beam (several options for screen
    placement)
3.  Audio/Video/VGA tie-in point accessible to presenters, with mic
4.  Noise absorbing panels installed wherever possible (get permission
    for installation if necessary, these really help!)
5.  Specified folding chair storage area near entrance or in entry hall
    for easy access
6.  Preference for folding tables so meeting/project space can be
    configured easily

## David Edwards' suggestions

I'd suggest keeping the lounge (the larger room) friendly (or at least
non-intimidating) to the non-geek. Think coffee shop-meets-lecture hall,
maybe a touch of cyber/cypher/steampunk. (Not to be confused with
"wanna-be mad scientist's discount emporium and dorm room" look that we
have now.) This is probably less expensive than it sounds, getting
colors and visual motifs is probably more important than actual
furniture. (Since Starbucks has spent bajillions on trying to refine
their "casual friendly meeting place to chat" store feel, it may not be
a bad place to start when considering look-and-feel...)

Other possibilities... Consider a bar-height counter down one side,
which is tall enough for people to work at standing or sitting on a
bar/lab stool. Do it right, and you can stash tables from the rest of
the room under it when you're trying to clear the center of the room.
Also, people sitting on bar/lab stools can see over people seated at
tables. Make sure the bar is wide enough for at least a mid-sized laptop
to sit (fully supported) at an angle (like, if someone has the laptop in
front of them and is turned to look at someone at the front of the
room)...

Lots and lots of power strips (think "power bricks", usually not that
much draw but usually awkward) and network jacks. I'm aware of the magic
of wifi, but if you get a room full of geeks with laptops (and phones,
and gadgets, and...) in for a sprint, wired connections may prove a bit
more durable. Also, if they're readily available cheaply, there are a
few power strips with USB charger jacks, which could be useful (for
phones, ipods, etc).

Consider a ceiling-mounted webcam (there are cheap 720p ones these days)
positioned to see the whiteboard, both to record presentations and to
record whiteboard state. Also consider a couple lights (even track
lighting) positioned to be able to really light up the front of the room
(does wonders for improving video quality).

Aesthetics: a little harder than it seems. Don't rush it, it's OK to try
stuff like painting a big chunk of wall (pretty easy when the room is
empty) and then say "oh, wow... OK, that color sucks". Get a group
vision, draw a lot of pictures, experiment a bit, keep notes so anyone
who can't be at meetings can follow the train of thought... There's some
stuff that we're stuck with because of room layout (we probably aren't
hanging the whiteboard in front of the windows, for instance), but we
have a lot of flexibility in other ways.

Consider as many room use cases as you can think of, including the
"someone's working on making a giant balloon and just needs a
decent-sized empty room to lay out stuff on the floor" case. (It's OK to
consider a use case and reject it... we probably aren't going to be
running an inductive forge in our space, for instance, they're way too
power hungry and we don't have ventilation for it. But, having
explicitly rejected it, anyone looking for work space at least knows we
considered it and don't think it'd work.)

Also consider how people are going to move through the room in various
use cases (because, if you have power strips and ethernet cables going
out to tables in the middle of the room, you probably are going to want
them running along the floor where people aren't walking). Make sure you
keep the entire exit route (including the hallway area) clear to a width
of about 4'.

It's ok to have a vision for the new space, and be a bit picky about
what goes in. There will be the stuff that HacDC buys, there'll be stuff
that members donate, and there will be random donations. It's OK to say
"thank you for your donation of beat-up plastic lawn chairs, but that's
really not the look we're going for here". Try to go for a consistent
look... For some stuff, like bookshelves, this can be relatively easy.
(For instance, if you say "Ikea Billy bookshelves in medium brown",
you're talking about probably 10% of the Craigslist bookshelves in DC,
and you end up with bookshelves that go together and for which you can
get replacement parts.)

Branding: We probably should find a way to work the HacDC logo into the
decor. Something understated and low-contrast, but that still makes it
easy to pick out photos as "oh, that was at HacDC".

Acoustic paneling: Get the fireproof (or at least fire resistant) kind.

## Physical Security Review

Update

-   New lock installed, new keys being distributed
-   Still need security policy
    [SecurityPolicy](SecurityPolicy)
-   Install 3rd floor camera
-   Install outdoor/dumpster camera
-   Consider gate on downstairs stairwell entrance (must ask other
    tenants/brian about this)
-   Fix up hallway area (more so that it looks nicer, than as a security
    measure)
-   Post signage in hallway areas for hacdc
-   Install more lights in front of church (must as other tenants/brian
    about this) - maybe motion sensitive?
-   Find new-ish used PC as new security camera computer
-   Inquire into locking 3rd floor stairwell door after hours

1.  Locks
    -   Existing lock core on door (external and internal back room) has
        unknown number of outstanding keys
    -   Moving existing HacDC lock set over or getting another more
        secure lock set
        -   Looking into a lock that is more difficult to bump/pick for
            external door
    -   Should we consider a different lock on the lab door since
        expensive equipment will be in there and there is nothing
        requiring non-HacDC access in that room?
2.  Fire/Alarm
    -   Need some inexpensive smoke dectectors, possibly 5 to cover the
        whole space
    -   Need fire extinguishers mounted near doors in both rooms and in
        room between restrooms - ABCD rated
    -   While a security alarm is probably not warranted, some sensors
        which are internet connected would not be out of the question:
        video, passive IR, temp/humidity, sound level, light, etc. with
        a nice web page to see everything. Sounds like a project!
3.  Power/Lights
    -   Question remains as to the capacity (current) of the outlets and
        how the circuits are arranged - will we overload and blow a fuse
        or trip breakers? At what current?
    -   All outlets were tested and dead outlets were covered with duct
        tape - please don't remove the tape and we should have an
        electrician come and find out why they are dead, we couldn't
        find the fault
    -   GFI outlet needs to replace the non-GFI version next to the sink
        if that outlet is made to work.
4.  Cooling
    -   AC placement - one window unit was placed in each room until the
        main AC is repaired
    -   We should acquire a couple of fans, at least one for each room
        to help distribute the cool air
5.  Existing Tenants
    -   Materials remaining were moved to the front room near the door
    -   Need to know final date for their occupancy so we can change
        locks over and move the remaining items
6.  Security Policy
    -   HacDC should think about writing a formal security policy and
        procedures to cover emergency situations and other security
        issues that may arise, including contact information and steps
        to take
7.  Alternate Entry
    -   Outside walls are very climbable but the windows are high and
        offer little leverage
    -   Recommend we test window latches, replace any broken and look
        into an inexpensive locking bar
8.  Repairs
    -   Outlets under window in the room nearest the entry door is free
        from wall anchors and needs repair - safety hazard
    -   Anchors for conduit around room's perimeter should be checked
        and any broken should be replaced

## Proposed art/design projects in space

-   [Redbeard's Hedy Lamarr mural
    idea](http://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/File:Hedy_lamar_v3.png)
-   LED lanterns be placed in the meeting room, along the wall behind
    the pillar (North wall)
-   Framed artwork be placed in the meeting room wherever it will not
    interfere with projection or windows
-   Bookshelves be placed in the meeting room
-   Event posters be placed on noise absorbing panels and added to in
    future
-   Posters showcasing HacDC events and projects be made as incidental
    advertising and placed on noise absorbing panels
-   HacDC Museum articles displayed in meeting room, preferably on top
    of bookshelves or above other stable items
-   Additional lighting from spiral compact fluorescent lamps in both
    areas installed near ceiling and controlled by existing light
    switches (get permission if necessary)
-   Neon signs be installed where possible (limited by electric access,
    other uses)
-   Default setup of meeting room is "lounge" -- mostly seating for
    laptop use and discussion.

## Meetings

### Meeting Minutes 5/28

Attended: Darius, Daniel P, Andy, Todd, Alberto, Brad, Alan, Redbeard,
Arc, Jamie, Darian

Process for moving

-   Phase 1 (move current stuff, make plan for member meeting)
-   Phase 2 (implement plan within two weeks of member meeting)

Phase 1 stuff to do tonight

-   Physical security review (windows, doors/locks, alarm?, etc)
-   Clean room (mop is in janitor closet, clean while floor clear)
-   Move tables and chairs, and one A/C to get new office functional

What was done:

-   Floor in back room and bathroom/hall was mopped/swept
-   Items and shelves moved to front room (front room is staging room)
-   long tables moved to back room to use a temporary office
-   A/C set up in each room
-   Stuff that would look stealable was mostly left in old office
    because old tenant still has access
-   security review was done (Darian, Andy Walker, etc)

To do:

-   Get internet working in new office
-   Take down bolted shelving
-   Set up back room with shelving/workstation tables
-   Set up front room as meeting/lounge room.
-   and then once it's functional... all the actual planning to change
    the space, and to present that plan at the member meeting.

Next meeting will be Tues June 1st at 7pm. There should be at least one
or two meetings after that to get all the To do items done.

### Meeting Minutes 6/4

Themes that keep coming up from member suggestions:

-   ceiling mounted projector in both rooms
-   webcam ready for recording presentations or white boards
-   white boards
-   consistent look
-   hacdc logo
-   configurable tables
-   space for each machine including safety space
-   sound dampening
-   power strips and wiring
-   couch vs not couch argument
-   speakers

Suggestions:

-   \$20 ikea tables as a platform for reproducible cheap solder
    stations (with pegboard hutches)
-   shelving / kitchenette setup next to sink for microwave, dishes,
    kitchen supplies, bathroom suplies

Discussion of use cases:

-   Regular use of 10-30 people in meeting room
-   Once a month overflow with 40-50 people (considering we may grow, up
    from once in a blue moon now)
-   Once in a while parties, where tables have to be moved

We had a great session drawing out a space plan:

-   post picture and details here!
