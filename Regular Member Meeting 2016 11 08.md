### President's Report {#presidents_report}

HacDC will be a founding member of Nation of Makers. Julia has been
nominated for the NoM board of directors and will be asking members to
vote for her there. Julia is also going to CCC this year, although not
presenting. She'll probably return, with t-shirts.

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

I haven't done the math this month, sorry. I was out of town all last
week. However I did talk to DCRA and verify we are registered as a
non-profit with DC. But we probably lack a solicitation license that we
ought to have. It's a \$420 fee but worth it to get everything in order
if we want to get grants or support from the DC government, etc, so
we'll do it. We should expect the rent to go up around this time of
year, as usual.

I'll add numbers after the meeting: Revenue \$1181. Expenses \$1125.
+\$55 in the black. However revenue includes \$160 earmarked donations
to project SpaceBlimp and doesn't yet include the expense (\$157 worth
of Helium). We have a little over six months worth of reserve funds and
about \$100 in bitcoins, which are ...quickly gaining in value
tonight...

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

***VOTE-POCALYPSE-GEDDON!***

It's (potentially) [the
