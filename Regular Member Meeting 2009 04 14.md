### Church Ethernet Project (Elliot Williams) {#church_ethernet_project_elliot_williams}

Elliot has met with the church several times about this lately. The
church is going to pay for the hardware and wiring, up to \$700, and we
would provide the labor.

Dave wrote a really good post on Blabber about what the costs involved
will be. Tim B said he has some 48 port managed Netgear switches.

It will take place April 25 (same day as RobotFest, but the church can
do it then, so we need to work with them.)

We need to buy stuff for it soon, probably this week. An individual may
buy it and be reimbursed by the church.

### Basement Space Update (Dan Barlow) {#basement_space_update_dan_barlow}

Tim C offered to give an update. This weekend, people sorted and moved
everything damageable by water off the ground. Today the space flooded,
so it's good that that happened.

We need to work on the water issues, and then get the wooden shelving
taken down in the upstairs space and move it for shelving downstairs.

Saturday the destruction will commence, so anyone available should come
back in for that.

Martin made a motion to ask for \$120 to buy 4 shelves for the basement.
Tim C. 2nd.

Motion carried with no objection.

### HacDC Door Entry System (Tim C) {#hacdc_door_entry_system_tim_c}

### [Tuesday Seminar Series](Tuesday_Seminar_Series) (Elliot W) {#tuesday_seminar_series_elliot_w}

plans to relinquish the Tuesday night spaces, unless someone can step up
and arrange events.

Todd offered to try to line up some speakers. Nick also offered to line
up some speakers.

Ben motioned to make Todd the [Tuesday Seminar
Series](Tuesday_Seminar_Series) coordinator. He will
coordinate with other members to arrange speakers for the first Tuesday
of every month.

### [Bylaws](Bylaws) Change (Serge W) {#bylaws_change_serge_w}
