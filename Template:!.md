\|`<noinclude>`{=html}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an auxiliary template allowing to encode "`|`" within template
parameters. It is **unnecessary** to get a "`|`" in these cases, better
use "`&#124;`" for this purpose. However the "`|`" delimiter for a Wiki
table has to be escaped by a template if it's used within a template,
see also [w:WP:QIF](w:WP:QIF).

Note that there's no such problem with "`!`" (exclamation mark), it only
affects "`|`" (vertical bar) in conjunction with the [m:Help:Parameter
default](m:Help:Parameter_default) mechanism within tables.
