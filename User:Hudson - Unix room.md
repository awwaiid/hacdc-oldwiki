I was looking for a quote by Ken Thompson about his #1 failure with
Unix's design (leaving the 'e' off the creat system call) and found this
interview response by Rob Pike (fellow co-conspirator in the invention
of Unix):

> One odd detail that I think was vital to how the group functioned was

I find that I miss the communal machine room environment and shared
machine Unix machines. These days everyone has Unix in their pocket
(hello, iPhone!) and private Unix laptops (hello, MacBooks!), so it is
far too easy to hide in the office, the cafe or at home rather than work
together with fellow geeks.

It also made it easier for new users to become inculculated into the
ways of doing things so that everyone had a shared culture. The global
Usenet culture was worlds different than the fractured web-forum world,
even after the beginning of the Eternal September. Anyone who posted
"FIRST!!1!" to Usenet would have received a stern talking to from a
local wheel user, rather than being able to flame-away from the privacy
of their own home.

In many ways, I wonder if the creation of spaces like
[HacDC](Main_Page) have more to do with a return to the
communal environment. It isn't pair programming in the XP sense, but
perhaps more communal discovery rather than communal development.
