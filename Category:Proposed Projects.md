-   [WWholoW (World Wide Holo-grid
    Web)](WWholoW_(World_Wide_Holo-grid_Web)): Study of the
    possibility of setting up a world-wide wireless difrraction pattern
    through appropriate ground/air based transmiting stations that
    utilise ionospheric waveguiding to impose a spherical holographic
    E/M pattern

of standing spherical harmonics. These could allow realizing an
implementation of David Gelertner's "mirror world" idea, way beyond
mobile/WiFi technology and much more robust to external disturbances.
