### Tim Slagle, Adafruit.com and tax issues {#tim_slagle_adafruit.com_and_tax_issues}

Adafruit.com announced they would give wholesale pricing to
hackerspaces, and I volunteered to sign us up and coordinate orders. I
also was concerned about non-profit and tax issues so I did some
investigating. Here is a summary of what I did and found:

-   I signed HacDC up with Adafruit's hackerspace program using email
    address hacdc@slagle.org (so I would get order correspondance.)
-   Once logged in, the website shows different pricing but ordering
    process is basically the same
-   Typical kit discount is 10% for Qty 1-9, 20% for 10-24, 30% for
    25-49, and 40% for Qty \>= 50
-   Discount is less for items Adafruit resells (like XBees and FTDI
    serial programming cable)
-   Adafruit offers quantity discounts for the general public so at Qty
    10 the hackerspace discount doesn't save us much
-   Minimum order is \$250

I had some concerns about (1) the impact of such sales on our non-profit
status, and (2) whether sales tax would be owed on the transactions:

1\. According to IRS pub 598 on Unrelated Business Income of Exempt
Organizations,

[`http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p598.pdf`](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p598.pdf)

"Any trade or business in which substantially all the work is performed
for the organization without compensation is not an unrelated trade or
business". So we are okay non-profit wise as long as people are
volunteering to do the work.

2\. For sales tax, I spoke with the DC Office of Tax and Revenue
(202-727-4TAX) and also a sales tax auditor Wayne Nickum (202-442-6586).

-   DC expects 6% sales tax on any sales of "tangible personal property"
    in the District
-   HacDC non-profit status doesn't matter for sales to individuals, and
    there is no "de minimus" threshold of sales
-   Sales tax paperwork is minimal once account is set up - more work in
    keeping track of sales

So, I think sales tax is an issue that we have to think about.

To avoid paying sales tax on kits used in HacDC functions, we could use
a donation model where people pay an optional recommended donation in
exchange for using a HacDC-purchased kit we would have in stock. Daniel
Packer and I liked idea of having a stock of kits available for
impromptu workshops and uC Monday activities.

Concerns about the "donation" model:

-   We would be buying kits and parts using membership revenue money -
    buying Qty 10 kits will cost hundreds of dollars, so membership
    support and approval is needed
-   I wouldn't want to tie up member money in inventory that isn't
    selling or getting used when it could go for other important things
-   Donation model is self-service and vulnerable to theft. This was
    less painful when parts are donated but HacDC could be out hundreds
    of dollars if a bin goes missing

There are other possibilities for avoiding the sales tax, like charging
a tuition for a class and then have the kit or parts be part of the
supplies given in the class, but I don't have a definitive answer yet.

However, I am not comfortable taking orders from individual members
under the "donation" model as it would look like we are evading sales
taxes. Also our current self-service parts "store" currently stocks
donated items and is not really set up for purchased inventory, which
both Dan Barlow and I agree should be kept separate and more carefully
accounted for. So, I would propose that if we want to do individual
Adafruit (or other purchased parts) orders, we treat them as a resale
and would need to charge sales tax. Unfortunately the 6% sales tax we'd
have to add largely offsets the 10% hackerspace discount for small
quantities, so I think the main advantage of the Adafruit discount would
be for workshops where \>=25 kits would be bought at one time.

I can still put together individual orders if people want, and I am
willing to do sales tax paperwork and accounting (at least for Adafruit
orders). The first order would be a set of kits to have on hand for
build workshops and uC Mondays, but I think membership approval would be
needed for me to spend the money. So, for the sake of discussion, I
would propose the following order:

  Qty   Desc                      List Price   Our Cost   Total
  ----- ------------------------- ------------ ---------- -------
  10    Arduino w/ATmega328       \$27         \$27       \$270
  10    DC Boarduino Kit          \$15         \$14       \$140
  10    Arduino Protoshield Kit   \$11         \$10.50    \$105
  10    Game of Life kit          \$15.75      \$14       \$140
        **TOTAL**                                         \$655

As can be seen, the costs add up when ordering in quantities of 10. I'm
happy to get whatever anyone wants and can agree on so don't worry if
you don't like these items - maybe we can discuss it more on the Members
list.
