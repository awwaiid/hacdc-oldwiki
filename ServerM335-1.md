# Overview

## HacDC-shared-m335-1

Simple project server, emphasis on availability and uptime.

Available services include root access (demonstrable need or willingness
to manage non-root users), non-root 'Debian Shell' access, and Xen
paravirtualized hosting (resources allocated by need and
first-come-first-serve).

Access is through SSH login. Specific Xen commands by non-root users
permitted through sudo, aliased for convenience. Extremely basic
knowledge of Linux command line use is required.

### Status

Ready for delivery to HacDC.

# General Policies

Applicable to all use of HacDC server resources.

## Commercialization

-   Resale of HacDC hosting services is subject to 501(c)3 provisions,
    and member acceptance. Within those restrictions, it is politely
    requested than any commercial users 'give back' fairly, upwards 5%
    of returns.

## Prohibited

At minimum, credentials and assets may be immediately deleted. Though
not official policy, server admins may take corrective action upon
discovery of any of the following, without limitation.

-   Contrary to HacDC's 501(c)3 mission.
-   Contrary to US public policy.
-   Prohibited by HacDC internal policy.
-   Jeopardizes HacDC or other HacDC members. Specifically, compromised
    accounts will be immediately disabled upon discovery, and may be
    immediately deleted.
-   Any form of spam, or activity which causes spam filters to reject
    mail from \*.hacdc.org.
-   Heavy internet use, reducing QoS for neighboring tenants.
-   Weak passwords.
