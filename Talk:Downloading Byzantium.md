NOTE TO EDITORS: the table should be ordered newest first and only full
releases and current development releases should be listed unless
there's a damn good reason otherwise. I've considered doing a simple
stoplight based color coding for the top 3 entries, development(red),
old/"stable"(yellow), and current(green) releases. but i think that
might be visually off putting and do more harm than good.
