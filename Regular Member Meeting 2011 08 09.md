## Director Reports

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report (Tim Slagle)

Here is the July 2011 financial summary:
<file:HacDC_Financials_July_2011.pdf>

We came out a bit ahead in July due to additional member donations, the
robotics class (\$200), and \$344 in cash collected from the tip jar.
Membership revenue are still \$600 short of our expenses so thanks to
the generous members who are chipping in extra. We ended July 2011 with
a reserve of about 2.5 months expenses.

In July, we had 43 paying members, three non-paying members, added two
new membership subscriptions (Bjorn Westergard & Stephen Beuttel), and
lost one member (Alan McCosh). Shahar Goldin also reactivated his
subscription and chipped in for a missing month, so thanks and sorry for
announcing his departure prematurely!

I found we were paying \$6/mo for a fax service we were no longer using,
so I cancelled it. We should have a plan for asynchronously receiving
faxes - Google Voice?

### Secretary's Report

Growing interest in Byzantium. We did a lot of talking, but not a lot of
coding at the last sprint.

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### Toast

Zine-fest happened. Poorly attended.

#### Brad B

A.I. Class coming up in October. We're hosting a study group.

Try to keep the space open more. Have a software night on Thursdays and
Tuesdays.

Paying dues again. Going to get people working on the Prusa Mendel.
