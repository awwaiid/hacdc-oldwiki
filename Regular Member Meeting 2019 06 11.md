## Member Reports {#member_reports}

-   Kevin: I continue to struggle with the TAZ 1.0 and am beginning to
    believe that there is a hardware failure. The system consistently
    fails to recognize where the home position of the Z axis is, and
    grinds the extruder into the bed. However, I've considerably shrunk
    the distance for moving the Z axis AWAY from the bed. Telling the
    TAZ to move the Z axis up 1 mm is now much closer to 1 mm instead of
    100 mm.

\[Karen note\]Julia may be coming to visit DC soon, so perhaps she can
take a peek.

Nonstop Art week of July 1 - see how they are using their space,

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

17 members, 2 of whom are students Took over square, can take cc
payments (reader in bod locker) Namecheap is registrar for hackdc.org -
don't think we need it. We'll keep it Need to do signature cards still
Still need to pay for HacDC's portion of dumpster rental Business
license \$26/month for two years - recommends paying it since we are
very close to the limit for those businesses that need a license Did a
survey of other spaces, membership fees are generally \$70/month -
should we raise membership fees for new members? Also work on benefit
offerings. Please remember to use smile.amazon.com
