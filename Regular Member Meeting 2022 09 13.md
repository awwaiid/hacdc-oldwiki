## [Approval of Previous Meeting's Minutes](Regular_Member_Meeting_2022_08_09)

## Recognition

-   Michelle, for continued work on the lease, formalizing basement and
    roof access, tightening up the language and accounting for all the
    details.

## Old Business

-   Oby got involved with [Iffy Books](https://iffybooks.net/) regarding
    their [mesh network
    jam](https://iffybooks.net/event/mesh-jam-day-1/). He was unable to
    attend the jam but has established a connection and has videos to
    watch.
-   Gabe will follow-up on setting up a Capture the Flag event.
-   Need kick off the Machine Learning class. Oby has extra time this
    month, and is thinking about getting the course material ready, but
    both he and Gabe feel an informal start just to get it going.
-   Announce group projects for Project Night.
-   Basement measurement: Still pending. Gabe tried to get in but was
    unable to find the key. He's been told where the key hides.
-   Gabe has brought a CanaKit Raspberry Pi for the 3D printers.

## New Business

-   There's been a vote to approve the lease, but as new clauses are
    being negotiated, I's crossed and T's dotted, it may need to be
    reviewed again.
-   Gabe will set up a regular "visit the space" informal. 7:00 - 9:00
    alternating Thursday nights. Visitors will need to both RSVP on
    Meetup and e-mail Blabber.
-   The "other" Thursday will be the informal Machine Learning
    gathering.
-   Any hosts for Capture the Flag? Tristan?
-   Ham radio club to provide [Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network
    (ARDEN)](https://www.arednmesh.org/content/what-aredn-network)
    support for the [Marine Corps
    Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Marathon).

### Treasurer's Report

-   Nothing unexpected.
-   Last month 20 members. This month 18.
-   Amazon Smile brought in just about one month of member dues (\$64).
-   Rent: \$990 this month going down to 922.50 in the future.
-   Revenues only about \$40 above expenses.
