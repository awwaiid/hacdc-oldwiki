## When and where?

We're having an open house and providing a place to hang out on Friday,
February 5th, 2010, from 8pm until late (2am?). That's right after
[Shmoocon](http://shmoocon.org/) wraps up for the night. As usual, this
event is free and open to the public; we'll be collecting donations,
though, and would greatly appreciate your support.

The lounge area will be in the dining room (in the basement).
