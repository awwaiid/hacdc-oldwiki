HacDC is in the process of refurbishing a scanning electron microscope:
a Cambridge Stereoscan 200.

# Current Status {#current_status}

June 23rd: Summary. Roughing pump works, seals adequate to fire turbo.
Probably just needs cleaning and testing, similar in scope to
commissioning a new 3D printer. -mirage335

March 31st: Cleaned the plinth and took photographs of the vacuum
components. [Available
here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45972/sem/sem_cleaning/index.html).

-   ~~Oil diffusion~~Turbo molecular pump was hanging due to the lip
    falling out of the rubber suspension. Could be cleaned and probably
    popped back in.

-   Broken switch on roughing pump was bypassed internally. Plugging in
    the outlet should activate the pump. (This pump normally runs 24/7
    when the machine is operational.)

```
-   Compressed air needed to get more dust out

March 30th: Moving complete! The SEM is now in the workshop

March 29th: Awaiting pick-up and installation (March 29th and 30th).

March 23rd: A space in the workshop has been cleared. Photo:

-   The original S200 operating instructions will be available at the

-   If possible, members will also have access to a PDF copy of
    *Scanning Electron Microscopy - A Student's Handbook*, 1980,
    self-published by Michael Postek, et al. This book was widely used
    by microscopists and is still regarded as a good learning reference,
    but the original binding is rare and prone to falling apart. It
    might be possible to use the PDF copy for private, educational use.

We'll have a list here of HacDC members who are responsible for the SEM,
including people that should be notified about problems.

# Supplies wishlist {#supplies_wishlist}

-   Apiezon M vacuum grease for "O" rings, to be used for vacuum seals
    at room temperature:
    <http://www.2spi.com/catalog/vac/apiezon/apiezon-m.php> (\$70 for
    25g). Edit: page 058 of the manual states "The use of O ring grease
    is not recommended on any O rings, but a small amount may be used,
    if necessary, on moving seals e.g. the specimen stage and apereture
    changer micrometers."
    -   31Mar2014 - there's a syringe of Ap. T grease in the space
        (\~2g). It's on top of the SEM's chamber atm.

-   Replacement "O" ring for chamber-\>gun vacuum tube, for the
    chamber-side mounting adapter. (Will this work?
    <http://www.grainger.com/product/O-Ring-1RHY8>)

-   Inland 19 pump oil for Edwards E2M-12 roughing pump:
    <http://www.sisweb.com/vacuum/sis/inland.htm> (\$30 per gallon)
    (needs confirmation that this oil is suitable)
