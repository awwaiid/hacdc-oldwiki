## Old Business {#old_business}

In-Person Events -- not having in-person group events for at least
another month as Delta is peaking. Members-only for the space right now.
Could have more than five people masked in the auditorium is another
option; might consider having a speaker (John). Digital art from your
photos might be one idea (Tayeb). Twilio Authentication -- Kevin/Tayeb
confirmed that the phone does work to call space but cannot link voice
mails Television Needs Repair -- Kevin and Tayeb will come to space on
Sunday to look at TV Open Project Night -- seems to be going well. Has
been a steady group of people Move to Hybrid Workspace -- partially
remote hackerspace, in-person hackerspace Capture the Flag -- 12p to 2p
on Saturdays. Might create an upper-track for another day/time-slot
maybe Tristian can host the advance variety CAD Night -- Tristian still
interested in this
