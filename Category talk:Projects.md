I propose revising the policy described here so that
[:Category:Projects](:Category:Projects) only contains the
subcategories [:Category:Ongoing
Projects](:Category:Ongoing_Projects), [:Category:Proposed
Projects](:Category:Proposed_Projects), and
[:Category:Abandoned Projects](:Category:Abandoned_Projects).
Individual project pages would belong to one of these subcategories but
not directly to [:Category:Projects](:Category:Projects).
This cleans up navigation and reduces redundancy. If no one objects,
I'll make this change within a couple of days. -
