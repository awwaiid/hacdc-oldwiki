## Recommended Printing Procedure

1.  Assuming Inkscape or Corel draw, make the default page size to be
    12"H x 20"W
    1.  In Corel, the page size options should be displayed in the
        toolbar directly above the drawing window, or also via the Tools
        -\> Option menu
    2.  In Inkscape, set the page size via the File -\> Document
        Properties menu. There is an option to resize page to image
        which is useful if you've imported a single part and duplicated
        it.
2.  Bound your drawing with a YELLOW box. Pull it as tight to your
    drawing as desired, the less space left, the less wastage, but you
    do want to leave a small margin, especially if you're cutting at the
    limits of the machine.
3.  Select all and set your line/stroke width to "Hairline" in Corel, or
    0.1px in Inkscape
4.  Print to the Microsoft XPS driver. It will ask you to save the file
    somewhere, and then immediately open the XPS viewer.
5.  Verify your print in the XPS Viewer, if it's not right here, it's
    not going to be right on the cutter.
6.  Open the Retina Engrave software, and open your XPS. Cut away!
