# Lasers

## Highly Safe (1mW)

Under some unusual conditions (eg. microscope viewing), extremely low
optical power is appropriate to minimize risk.

## Safe (5mW)

Low power lasers (\<5mW) are eye-safe, useful for manual alignment, HUD
prototypes, etc.

## Moderate (\~200mW)

Medium power lasers emit a beam powerful enough to cause severe
permanent retinal damage if directly viewed. However, at substantially
less than Class IV power, indirect viewing (ie. spot on wall, specular
reflections, etc) is relatively safe. This compromise can be useful to
illuminate large areas, project a near-daylight visible green beam under
standard atmospheric conditions, and burn some darkly colored objects.

-   UV - HacDC already has a bunch, 405nm estimated in the 50-150mW
    range.

## High-Power Class IV (\>0.5W) {#high_power_class_iv_0.5w}

Above 0.5W, even indirect viewing is immediately blinding. Extremely
dangerous, must be used with safety glasses and/or other shields. Use is
generally restricted to members or trusted guests with safety training.

Despite the risks, high-power lasers are often necessary and justified
for cutting, sintering, photoexposure, LIDAR, ICF, etc.

-   Far Infrared (\~10micron) - Primarily useful for cutting. Safer than
    other Class IV lasers, as retinal damage is limited by opaque eye
    lens. See HacDC
    [:Category:LaserCutter](:Category:LaserCutter) .
-   Near Infrared (\~1micron) - Primarily useful for cutting. Dangerous
    invisible laser beam, any viewing is blinding. -

-   UV - Useful for photolithography, high-precision cutting,
    fluorescent illumination, and more. Extremely dangerous,
    catastrophic non-thermal retinal damage, any viewing is instantly
    blinding. -

# Lenses

## Specialty

### Fresnel

Large flat lenses, useful for low-divergence collimation of non-laser
light sources (ie. spotlights), dim direct projection of ordinary
displays.

### Large Diameter Short Focal-Length

HacDC has a variety of large diameter short-focal length lenses,
typically used in projection. Additionally, the following can be
obtained for unusual situations.

### Condenser Lenses

Aspheric lenses can provide faster collimation with better performance
across a white-light spectrum. For microscopes and projectors, this can
be important.

### Holographic

For a single wavelength, holographic optical elements may offer
aggressive performance and ideal convergence.

## Random

Various lenses have been collected from scrap CD/DVD players, disposable
cameras, scrap projectors and other sources.

## Table Ready

Lenses with focal lengths that factor to the optical table tap spacing
are efficient for prototyping optical beampaths.

# Diffusers

Various diffuser materials are routinely extracted from dead or
low-value LCD monitors. Note these may be combined with focused
high-intensity light sources and wide-diameter lenses to achieve rapid
beam expansion and homogenization. Adding vibration can achieve a
speckle-free laser light source.

# Filters

## Dichroic

HacDC has a variety of dichroic mirrors, typically angle tunable. For
specific situations, the following may be useful.

-   TODO 532nm
-   TODO 405nm

## Spatial

For scientific or industrial applications, diffusion is not efficient or
adequate to clean up laser beam profiles. Pinhole filters are used
instead. Note the result is typically NOT speckle free.

## Polarizing

Various polarizing filters have been obtained from a variety of sources.

# Mirrors

## Splitters

Semi-silvered mirrors can divide a beam in two. This effect can also be
used to create one-way optical coupler, separating transmitted and
received beams.

## Plain

Ordinary mirrors have been obtained from scrap projectors. Hard disk
platters can also be used.

# Extrusions
