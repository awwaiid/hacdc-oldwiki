## Recognition

I filed a bunch of paperwork for the CFC application. - Enrique Tom made
the TV server much better and added good instructions for VNC remote
desktop. Thanks Tom!

## New Members {#new_members}

Karen and Ben by acclamation.

## Old Business {#old_business}

Need an annual meeting and board election date.

## New Business {#new_business}

Enrique - I'd like to be reimbursed for the \$340 CFC application fee.
Nancy C. W.: How can we get more volunteers to write articles for the
HacDC Website?

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project SUPPLIES - Mirage {#project_supplies___mirage}

### Project EXPANSION - Mirage {#project_expansion___mirage}

### Project HAMRADIO - Jeff {#project_hamradio___jeff}

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM) - Julia {#project_electron_microscope_sem___julia}

Enrique - I purchased a vacuum valve, tee and other minor hardware. We
could 1) mount the gauge on the rough pump to see how low that pressure
goes, 2) blank off the gauge flange and tee the gauge between the pumps
to measure turbo backing pressure.

### Project Optical Table Robot (OTR) -Julia {#project_optical_table_robot_otr__julia}

### Project CRISPR -Enrique {#project_crispr__enrique}

Our last experiment was a failure: the unmodified bacteria thrived on
the antibiotic-free plate but not the antibiotic plate. Of note, we
failed to culture the bacteria properly to start with, although the
growth on the plain plate shows lots of bacteria were present in the
CRIPR'd solution. Also the single run used up all the Cas9 protein and
templateDNA; the free sample the vendor sent was unexpectedly one-fifth
of the regular amount. Nancy C. Wolfson and Enrique Cobas

### Project SpaceBlimp -Enrique {#project_spaceblimp__enrique}

Nancy C. Wolfson

We're having biweekly meetings in anticipation of February launch date,
also a big work-meeting on a Saturday to work building payloads. Nancy
C. W. coordinated the incorporation of Unallocated Space so this is now
officially a three-hackerspace launch. Nancy went to SilverSat to see
how far along they are building CubeSats. For many more details,
subscribe to <spaceblimp@hacdc.org>. Also, Nancy C. Wolfson is
coordinating the participation of Wikipedia and The Houston Elementary
School, plus the participation of the Spacebimp Project in the Science
and Engineering festival 2018 (invited by one of the organizers G. M.)

### Project IT Infrastructure - Tom {#project_it_infrastructure___tom}

Signed up for Linode account. We can probably get a \$5-\$10 monthly VPS
which will be a big improvement over our "free" as in costly liability
dreamhost account.

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

**Enrique** - the CFC campaign is in the Fall. Federal employers host
'fairs' where charities are invited to set up booths that their
employees can peruse and hopefully donate money to. We need to find out
about these and get invited. I can do NRL and maybe NASA. There are many
other labs and agencies in DC that might have amenable employees: NIST,
NIH, NASA, NSA, ARL, FDA, EPA, DoD, etc. If you know federal employees,
try to remember to ask them about their CFC coordinators. We'll also
need volunteers to staff such booths at each fair.

**Kevin** - Works in progress (or regress):

-   The pieces of a VoIP [Teleconferencing
    System](Teleconferencing_System) are all functional, but
    I want to build a box around them and strap them down so that they
    don't become separate pieces with lost parts... again.
-   Speaking of lost stuff, I've almost finished designing a
    3D-printable passport stamp complete with documentation on how to go
    from an SVG to a reasonably high resolution STL.
-   [Klipper](Klipper) will be continued when I can have
    someone "ride shotgun" while I try it out on Aden's rebuild. (I need
    to know that his rebuild is in a working state before I break it.)

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff) {#director_reports_governance_related_stuff}

### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

I'm kind of sick so we'll see if I can make it all the way to the VP's
report. I may have to leave early in which case see below:

I'm just going to go ahead and start developing (aka doing) a recycling
program if nobody has any input on it. I've emailed members about it in
the past. I'll report back about how it's going and maybe it will get
widely adopted.

The classroom TV now is powered now by a nice robust 5yo gaming PC with
an Nvidia 6x0. There have been some upgrades to the other 3d PC as well.

The occupancy sensor is OoO again. My CHiP got frizzed. It may be due to
the fluorescent lighting on the circuit, so I will look into building it
back with some kind of shielding or surge protection after talking with
somebody who knows about EE.

We need a better WAP. I've got one potential LEDE/OpenWRT capable
device.

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}

### Kevin

-   Waiting for call-backs / e-mail-backs from the Open Technology
    Institute re: Ken's neighborhood opportunity centers / makerspaces /
    hackerspaces... I may need to nudge again soon.
