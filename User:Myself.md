I'm [Nate](https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/User:Nbezanson). I'm from
Detroit. While I was in town, I worked on on shelving, storage,
organization, and general physical infrastructure for HacDC. I built the
shelves above the sink and behind the door in the old space, and I built
the elevating whiteboard/screen setup at the front of the room. I'm back
in Detroit now, but hope to visit again soon.

Since leaving HacDC, I tried and failed to start
[one](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Detroit_Facility) hackerspace in
Detroit, but got involved in
[another](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/I3_Detroit) which is [pretty big
now](https://www.i3detroit.org/wiki/In_the_Media). HacDC members are
welcome to swing by and meet us, if you're in the area.
