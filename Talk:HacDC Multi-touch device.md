## Roadmap

I propose to keep the general roadmap simple:

-   Build prototype (alpha)

The alpha, we can build using currently known techniques; to get working
knowledge of the limitations of the device.

-   Build improved prototype (beta), customized for HacDC

The beta will be improvments to the alpha, as suggested by project
members and HacDC membership

-   Build production device

The production device will be a functional product, built with the
finest quality workmanship possible.
