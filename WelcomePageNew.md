to HacDC. We are a hacker space located in Washington, DC. HacDC members
improve the world by creatively rethinking technology. We break, build,
and occasionally abuse technology in the pursuit of greater knowledge
about how it works and repurposing it to build new things. Our shop is
located in the

Columbia Heights\] neighborhood of the District of
Columbia.`</span>`{=html}
