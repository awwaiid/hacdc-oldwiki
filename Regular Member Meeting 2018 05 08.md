## Member Reports

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff)

### President's Report

I received a lot of good feedback on a code of conduct/rules of the road
at the last member meeting/bod meeting but have made no further
progress. Good suggestions from a visiting maker from Orlando for forms
(jot forms).

### Vice President's Report

`   20:44 < hacdc-meeting-op> installed a duplexer and ordered a ram module upgrade for the hp printer`\
`   20:44 < hacdc-meeting-op> openwrt router for classroom on archer C7`

### Treasurer's Report

More slow recollection of past dues. With the retroactive dues paid by
several members, we more or less broke even this month.

There was an issue with the Paypal payments for several of the members
whose dues had not been collected over the past 7 months, but after
talking with support that appears to be resolved. As such we have
already collected many more past dues this month and will collect many
more soon. We are currently charging affected members \$100 a month
(\$40 over normal dues for most people), and most people owe about \$360
or \$420 so the dues should be paid back in 8 months.

Vote to reimburse Julia for the IPS monitor and the little red wagon
(\$185) passes. Vote to reimburse Tayeb for 10 HacDC keys (\$25.71)
passes.

### Secretary's Report

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### Kevin

Nothing additional to report.

#### Ken

Drafted a project proposal to formalize a lot of the ideas around
implementing a program in partnership with a community-based
organization in an under-served area: do demos, make connections, get
feedback on proposed project. Need space/support/partner. Shooting to
have draft ready for review by HacDC membership next month.
