[Turning
Operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning#Turning_operations)

The beginner task I always taught was actually a lathe-and-mill combo
called a "mosquito bath." It was a nonsense assembly that served no
purpose other than to teach students the different operations. See
attached drawings. (I still have my mosquito bath to this day.)

Depending who you ask, the most basic operations are:

`   * Facing*`\
`   * Turning*`\
`   * Drilling*`\
`   * Tapping*`\
`   * Grooving`\
`   * Filing*`\
`   * Parting*`

The ones with an asterisk are covered in a part like the mosquito bath
stem. The more advanced operations we could do are:

`   * Boring`\
`   * Knurling`\
`   * Face Grooving`\
`   * Thread-cutting`

Things Needed

`   * Metal Stock`\
`   * Cutting Tool`\
`   * Cutting Fluid (bottle)`\
`   * Drill Chuck`\
`   * Center Drill`\
`   * Tap & Die Set`\
`   * Drill Bits for Metal (set)`\
`   * Cutoff Tool`\
`   * Boring Bar`\
`   * Metal Files`\
`   * Scotch Brite`
