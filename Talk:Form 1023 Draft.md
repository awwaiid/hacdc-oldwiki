I think we need to be able to answer yes to these. 4a. Conflict of
interest should be avoided. What do we consider a conflict of interest?
Is there a legal definition we can point to and say "we use that"? 4b.
Should always be Yes. Currently we can spend up to \$500 without
approval. I suggest that should be limited to supplies, and any
compensation should have to be approved in advance at a voting meeting
of the membership. 4c. Following 4b. the documentation would be the
approved minutes of the meeting where the compensation was approved.

I personally agree, but this clause deals specifically with compensation
for services, i.e. paying staff for services. We're presently precluded
from paying directors & officers for services via the bylaws. I agree
that we should put a conflict of interest policy in place for
reimbursements, and include a strict procedure for when and why we would
pay anyone for their services...but they're not asking about straight
reimbursements for goods or even the authorization to do so in this
