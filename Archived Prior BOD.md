## The [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors) (Set by Bylaws)

The [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors), per our
[Bylaws](Bylaws) consists of [the
Ministers](the_Ministers) and two At-Large Directors. The
[Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors) at HacDC is largely
ceremonial. Members generally directly decide on all issues before
HacDC. Only certain minutiae and other actions required by law are
carried out by the [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors).

Despite direct membership control wherever possible, the [Board of
Directors](Board_of_Directors) remains primarily responsible
for the affairs of HacDC under District of Columbia Corporate Law.

### [The Ministers](The_Ministers)

Most corporate law refers to "officers". [The
Ministers](The_Ministers) are our Corporate Officers and
serve in the following roles:

-   [Coordinator in Chief](Coordinator_in_Chief) = President
    and Chairman of the [Board of
    Directors](Board_of_Directors)
-   [Minister of Information](Minister_of_Information) =
    Executive Vice President and Vice Chairman of the [Board of
    Directors](Board_of_Directors) (and Chief Information
    Officer)
-   [Keeper of the MIBS](Keeper_of_the_MIBS) = Secretary
-   [Minister of Finance](Minister_of_Finance) = Treasurer

### At Large Directors

The At Large Directors are the membership's direct representation on the
[Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors). At Large Directors
should be regular members who are not involved with the day-to-day
running of HacDC. They are there to offer advice and perspective to [the
Ministers](the_Ministers) and act as a form of internal
control.

## Current [Board of Directors](Board_of_Directors)

Prior board of directors.
