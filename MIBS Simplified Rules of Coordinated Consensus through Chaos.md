[MIBS](MIBS) SRC3 is the standard procedure for handling
meetings of HacDC. It is designed to be a replacement for [Robert's
Rules of Order](wikipedia:Roberts_Rules). Version 1.0 was
written by [Nick Farr](User:Nickfarr) who said:

"Roberts Rules of Order was designed for people who like meetings and
can't stand each other. [MIBS](MIBS) SRC3 is designed for
people who hate meetings, generally get along pretty well, but can
sometimes get pretty opinionated and obstinate about thorny issues AND
tend to ramble on at length. **This process is designed to bring drama
down to a manageable level**."

## The Basic Ideas:

-   Keep meetings as short as possible
    -   Keep everyone informed
    -   Keep the discussion on track while encouraging different ideas
        and perspective.
    -   Give everyone a chance to speak and offer solutions

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Handle problems outside of meetings
    -   **Take basic input and solve problems outside of meetings** Most
        everything should be decided on the wiki, over mailing lists and
        any other communication method that reaches all members.
    -   Come to meetings with solutions, finalize them in the meeting.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Keep drama manageable
    -   Try to achieve unanimous consensus
    -   When consensus does not seem possible, postpone and re-work
        until you can.
    -   When solutions keeps being postponed, the majority rules.

## Before the meeting

1.  If you are working on something cool, bring your elevator pitch!
    -   Let everyone at the meeting know about it!
    -   Post to the wiki, blog, etc.
    -   Stick around after the meeting to demo, answer questions, etc.
2.  Avoid bringing issues to meetings. Solve them on your own.
    -   Avoid making new policies.
    -   Avoid bureaucracy.
    -   Use e-mail, the wiki, IRC, Jabber, tacking notices to the wall
        and any other communication method to define the problem and
        seek solutions.
3.  When issues cannot be solved by daily consensus, (or require
    membership/board approval for legal reasons) submit them for the
    next meeting as an agenda item. Make sure each agenda item has:
    -   A BRIEF SUMMARY of the relevant problem
    -   A more comprehensive discussion of
        -   WHAT the problem is
        -   WHY it's relevant to the membership, board, etc.
        -   WHO is involved
    -   Describe the proposed solutions. List pros and cons of each
        solution.
    -   Propose ONE BEST SOLUTION as official agenda proposal to be
        adopted in the "Consent Agenda"
    -   Suggest the time it should take to achieve resolution on the
        issue.
4.  All agenda items should be submitted at least 48 hours in advance of
    a meeting, but may be added at any meeting by any member--provided
    what the issue to be discussed and how to resolve it is clear.

## The Meeting Agenda

Each meeting should have an agenda. The cut-off time for addition to or
revision of the the agenda's items is 11:59 PM on the Saturday preceding
a regular Tuesday meeting. This allows the members about three days to
review the agenda and proposals, to see if they have any objections
worthy of pulling the item from the agenda.

The agenda should include:

I. Draft minutes of the last meeting : The Keeper of the [MIBS](MIBS) (Secretary) shall type up the meeting minutes highlighting all the relevant ideas and arguments presented by each member for each agenda item at each meeting, as well as providing a list of members present at each meeting. The minutes of any meeting shall be posted in draft form immediately after the meeting and continually revised by the members until "perfect". In a perfect meeting, members have read the minutes and made any necessary corrections by 11:59 the Saturday following a member meeting.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

II\. The Consent Agenda : Each of the newly proposed agenda items appears in the consent agenda. Any member present at any meeting may pull an item out of the consent agenda for discussion, at which point it goes under "New Business". If nobody objects to the solutions presented by the consent agenda, everything in the consent agenda passes by consensus. (This is to encourage people to discuss solutions and policies ahead of time.) In a perfect meeting, the consent agenda passes everything without actual discussion, because it was discussed and agreed to before the meeting. This meeting agenda shall be frozen at 11:59, the Saturday prior to the meeting to encourage members to review and discuss the agenda in its final form prior to the meeting.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

III\. Minister Reports : Each of [The Ministers](The_Ministers) should submit an official report by Saturday at 11:59pm. During "Minister Reports" questions from the membership of interest to the membership at large should be fielded by the officers. In a perfect meeting, everyone already asked their questions of the officers and the officers included those answers in their report.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

IV\. Member Reports : Each member who has work or a proposed project they wish to share with the group may ask for time to address to the group, but in no case more than one minute to talk and one minute to answer quick questions. If there are many agenda items to discuss, the [Coordinator in Chief](Coordinator_in_Chief) may limit Member Reports to five minutes. Members should, but need not put their intention to give a report in the agenda.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

IV\. Old Business : These are the issues that remained unresolved from the last meeting. In a perfect meeting, there is no old business.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

V. New Business: These are the issues from the consent agenda that were pulled out for discussion. In a perfect meeting, there is no new business.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

VI\. Adjournment: No meeting should last more than 60 minutes, especially if it starts at 19:30. In a perfect meeting, all business can be wrapped up in two minutes, allowing more time for showing off and collaborating on cool projects.

## Meeting Procedures

One person speaks at a time

-   No person speaks for more than one minute when others are waiting to
    speak.
-   The Coordinator in Chief will recognize only one person speaking at
    any time and clearly indicate who that is.
-   The Coordinator in Chief will strive to make sure each person is
    heard in discussion or each person's objection is heard before
    giving any person a second chance to talk.

Asking for objections.

-   The Coordinator in Chief will ask for objections to a given item or
    action. When they say, "Any objections?" or "Anything else?", they
    are asking for objections.
-   Any member may object simply by indicating "Yes!".
-   If there are no objections after three seconds, then the item or
    action is approved, and/or the meeting moves on.
-   If any member objects, they have fifteen seconds to explain why,
    then the relevant formal objection procedure takes hold.

Asking to extend time.

-   The Coordinator in Chief shall give a verbal and visual cue of time
    remaining in each item. 5, 2, 1 and "Time" cues should be given.
-   If time is called, a person may finish their sentence. After the
    sentence is finished, any member *except the one speaking* may call
    out, "More time, please!".
-   The Coordinator in Chief will ask, "Any objections?"
    -   If there are no objections to granting more time, the same
        amount of time as originally allotted or as indicated below is
        granted. Otherwise, the meeting moves on.
    -   If objections exist, it goes to a majority vote: "All in favor
        of extending time?" (Count those in favor), "All opposed to
        extending time" (Count those opposed). Majority vote rules.
    -   In the case of an agenda item under discussion if an extension
        of time fails, or a solution has not been reached by the first
        extension of time, it automatically goes to old business for the
        next meeting. (The idea being that members will seek resolution
        through other communication methods by the next meeting.)

Asking for additions/changes.

-   The Coordinator in Chief will ask for additions or changes to be
    made, saying "Anything else?".
-   Any member may propose an addition by indicating "Yes!" then stating
    what they would like to add or change.
-   If there are no further additions or changes after three seconds,
    the meeting moves on.

Ask for a vote.

-   After one minute of discussion on old business or five minutes of
    discussion on any new business item, any member may ask for a vote
    between speakers by saying, "Vote please!".
-   The Coordinator in Chief will ask for objections
-   If the majority has objections to calling a vote, discussion
    continues with the same time allotted as if no up or down request
    was made.
-   If there are no objections to a vote, or the majority wants the
    vote, the Coordinator in Chief will Clarify the proposals being
    discussed
-   Each of the proposals will be stated preceded by "All in favor of?".
-   Each member may vote only once for each alternative.
-   The alternative with the highest votes wins and the meeting moves
    on.

## Meeting Process

At the scheduled time, if people are generally ready, the Coordinator in
Chief will start the meeting by saying, "Get comfortable and get quiet,
we're starting," and ask the following questions or making the following
statements in the following order:

1.  "Does anyone have any items to pull out of the consent agenda for
    discussion?"
    -   If yes, wait for members to pull things out of the consent
        agenda.
    -   Any member present may pull an item out of the consent agenda.
    -   Who pulls items out must be recorded.
    -   Consent agenda items are discussed in the order they appeared in
        the agenda.
    -   Whatever is left in the consent agenda is approved and the
        meeting moves on.
2.  "Does anyone have any other new items to add to the agenda"
    -   Any member may add themselves to Member Reports provided time is
        available. If more than 10 members have a report, the
        coordinator in chief may limit member reports time.
    -   New business items that do not appear in the consent agenda may
        only be added at the discretion of the coordinator in chief.
3.  Does anyone have any revisions to the minutes?
    -   If yes, wait for revisions.
    -   Revisions should be a free flow discussion between the KotM and
        the group at large.
    -   Members may only change what they said or acted upon.
    -   If there are no further revisions, ask for objections to moving
        on.
    -   If time is reached, Ask to Extend Time. Time may only be
        extended once, the minutes revision becomes a New Business
        agenda item.
4.  "Do the officers have their reports?"
    -   Each officer gets five minutes to give a report, if no written
        one was submitted and five minutes of Q&A.
    -   Each officer reports may be extended for time once by majority
        vote.
    -   Another extension automatically puts the report in New Business.
    -   Once nobody responds to, "Anything else?", or time is reached
        and not extended, the meeting moves on.
5.  "Do the Members have their reports?"
    -   Members on the agenda and members who added themselves to the
        Member Reports section have one minute to talk and one minute
        for Q&A.
6.  "Moving on to old business!"
    -   Each item of old business may be discussed for no more than 5
        minutes.
    -   If no solution to the issue raised in Old Business is reached
        after two meetings, the item may not be discussed at a meeting
        for two weeks.
7.  "Moving on to new business."
    -   Those submitting the proposal will be allowed no more than 10
        minutes to explain the proposal and have a Q&A sesssion.
    -   After those submitting the proposal are finished, the time
        remaining is used for discussion.
8.  "Adjournment?".
    -   If all business is taken care of, the meeting is automatically
        adjourned by declaration of the [Coordinator in
        Chief](Coordinator_in_Chief)
    -   90 minutes after the meeting begins the chair must call time for
        the meeting.
    -   Any member may extend for no more than a half hour.
    -   At 120 minutes, the meeting shall be automatically adjourned by
        declaration of the [Coordinator in
        Chief](Coordinator_in_Chief)
    -   All remaining new business items are moved into old business for
        next week.
