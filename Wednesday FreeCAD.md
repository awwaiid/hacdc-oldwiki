Learn the FreeCAD suite, an open source project seeking to provide a no
strings attached alternative to Autodesk Fusion, SketchUp, and other
restrictive and closed solutions. Share your progress and projects, or
let us join you in working through snags and points of confusion. Design
your own models for 3D printing, laser-cutting, or any other fabrication
process.
