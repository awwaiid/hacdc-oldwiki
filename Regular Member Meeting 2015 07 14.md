## Director Reports

### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

#### Etiquette

Apparently, quoting bylaws in overly formal requests for IT admin
credentials after a busy day is not the best way to make friends. Well,
my mistake. Anyway, my use of "please" and "thank you" might have been
rather sparse these last few months while getting things done, so please
don't take offense.

#### Old Occupancy Sensor, Hacking

Old occupancy sensor is a nifty hack, an OpenWRT WiFi router sporting an
internal microcontroller wired to the serial port. Since there haven't
been any major issues with it in over a year, I am thinking of leaving
it in place for the light sensors.

For the new, NetPLC system RFID support, we still need an appropriately
sized electronic latch.

#### Starlight

New Shell/VPS server, [Starlight](Starlight), is now online,
8 cores, 16GB RAM. It tends to run a bit hot though, with the RAM DIMMs
reaching \~105C.

#### Grants

##### CapitalOne, AngelHack

At the Maker Faire, we reached out to Capital One. We are still
following up with them. Coincidentally, AngelHack, partnering with
CapitalOne, would like to make us a community partner for their event
(some free PR), in exchange for sharing some PR on their behalf as
follows.

Business minded hackers (\*ahem\* Nell) should especially check this
out.

##### Edmund Optics

Bit of a long shot, but if we win, we get up to \$10k in much-needed
high-end optical products. Finalists will be announced September 2nd.
Greatly appreciate Phil Stewart's advice narrowing the scope of our
application to a specific project (microscopic
projection/scanning/alignment tool for 3D printers).

### Treasurer's Report

"\[Still don't have access to the PayPal account. Paperwork was filed
with PayPal recently and we should expect and acknowledgement and
resolution later this week or early next week at the latest. Julia is
planning to be at 3D Thursday.\]"

### Secretary's Report

I don't have a roster of members in good standing until we get a report
of PayPal dues.

A date for a TOOOL Intro Lockpicking class is still to be decided, but
upcoming.

### Director-at-Large Reports

#### Phil

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports

### Project LASER

### Project BYZANTIUM

Development has been halted indefinitely. Basically, none of us have the
time or motivation to continue to the project. I don't see that changing
in the foreseeable future. This PA project should be canceled and any
earmarked funds reclaimed to the general fund.

## Member Reports

## Old Business

## New Business

-   We need to file a bianual report with the District of Columbia Dept.
    of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, and we need to change our
    registered agent. This was previously Martin, who doesn't live in DC
    anymore. A DC resident must be the registered agent for HacDC.

-   Let's discuss establishing a 'qualified users,' list for things like
    the CNC Mill, Lathe, Laser Cutter, SEM, some chemicals, etc. I think
    that means appointing some people as qualifiers and doing some kind
    of training or qualification assessment.-Enrique

<!-- -->
```
-   Let's charge fees on MeetUp RSVPs and refund the fees to those who
    come to the event. I think this will give us a more accurate RSVP
    count from the start. The events will still be free in the end but
    we'll be charging a no-show penalty. Discuss... -Enrique

-   CryptoParty 2015?
