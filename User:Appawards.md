**Why do iPhone users think they are "too good" for Androids?**

A majority of the people who switch to using iPhones or have used
iPhones since their release would never think of getting an

Android device. They put off the air to many of their friends that they
are too good for an Android powered device. Both phones

have their followings and Android users also back their phones. Why
though do a lot of coffee-shop iPhone users think that they

are too good for Androids? There are several reasons that this may be
true.

First, Apple took the smartphone world by storm when it was first
released. It spent a lot of money in marketing and it worked,

really well. Apple was able to get its teeth into the American market
and people just won't stop buying Apple devices. Part of

this may be out of habit. For some people an Apple device is all they
know so they assume it is better than anything else on the

market.

Apple products cost more. The one thing that Apple is known for, even
among some of its users, is its price. Apple has released

a smart watch (Apple Watch Edition) that has an amazing \$10,000 price
tag for the entry line model and can go all the way up to

\$17,000. With such high prices it is obvious that Apple is catering to
the richer population around the world. By buying the

higher priced devices people feel like they are better than the people
who pay less for their phones. As documented by Dan Lyons

on readwrite Apple users have developed a mindset where if you do not
own a Apple device you own a sub-par device.

The tech news industry has done little to help with the iPhone users
view of other devices or of Android users themselves. In an

Article on Gizmodo by Sam Biddle he states that "Android is popular
because it's cheap, not because it is good." He uses

references to a Samsung ad where a lower-income American family is using
a Galaxy Note 2. He implies that because this family

can afford it, anyone can. We do not agree with this statement by any
means, but it's possible someone out there does.

With public claims like this and the foothold that Apple has been able
to grab in the United States it's not hard to see why

Apple users think they are better than everyone else. It seems to be
that it is human nature to shun all those that are

different from you and it turns out that applies to phone ownership too.
