# Collocation

Collocation is a bare-bones service we provide at extremely low rates to
members and non-members.

Collocation fees are very affordable at \$15/U/month for members and
\$25/U/month for non-members and must be approved by the Admin team. For
tower servers, member rates are \$25/month for smaller towers and
\$50/month for full size towers. For very small, low-power devices such
as a Raspberry Pi, there is a minimum token fee of \$5/month and the
possibility of differnet physical locations, at Admin team's decision.

If the mission of a server is in line with HacDC's the admin team may
reduce or waive fees. The money from collocation fees goes towards the
furthering of HacDC's mission and to the maintenance and improvement of
our IT infrastructure.

The admin team will do their best to secure and maintain HacDC's
collocation network and facilities but we make no warranty as to their
physical or virtual safety, uptime, timeliness of service, or any other
niceties. Members should keep this in mind and be willing to cooperate
with Admin for any special needs they feel they may have.

For the time being, members may access their collocated server's
physical location to perform maintenance at any time. Interference with
the performance of other servers by accident or malfeasance may be
grounds for terminating the collcation arrangement.

Non-members will have to rely on a member of the Admin team for access
to their physical device.

HacDC will provide power, an ethernet port, and a rack; if your machine
becomes unresponsive, the admin team will try to provide power-cycle
service within 24 to 48 hours.

ANY device found hardwired to ethernet that isn't HacDC infrastructure
or a known collocated device will be turned off and disconnected.

If collocated devices are found to be violating our ISP's TOS, threating
damage to our facilities, or otherwise pose a significant issue to
HacDC's operations, they will be turned off pending resolution of the
issue.

HacDC and the Admin team may decide at any time for any reason that we
no longer wish to host a device. We will make reasonable efforts to
contact the owner of the server to arrange for collection and tell them
the reason.
