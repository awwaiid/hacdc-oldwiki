## What is Khaos?

From [ Khaos on Wikipedia](wikipedia:khaos)

In Greek mythology, **Chaos** or **Khaos** is the original state of
existence from which the first gods appeared. [
Ovid](wikipedia:Ovid), in his
*[Metamorphoses](wikipedia:Metamorphoses_(poem))*, described
Chaos as "rather a crude and indigested mass, a lifeless lump,
unfashioned and unframed, of jarring seeds and justly Chaos named". From
that, its meaning evolved into the modern familiar "complete disorder".
