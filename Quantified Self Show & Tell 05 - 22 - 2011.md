We'll meet at 6, schmooze a while, and start presentations around 7.

# Presenters

**Xaq Rothman**: Tracking smoking with CigLog, a webapp I wrote.

**Bjorn Westergard**: Dietary logging with Cron-O-Meter, journaling with
tiddlywiki, carrying a gps logger, DIY pulse-oximeter.

**Erica Kane**: Using a Bodybugg to monitor calorie burn, and to confirm
or deny common beliefs about weight loss.

**Elephant Ninja**: Using the sticker method to track and improve
pull-ups.

**Matthew Velderman**: A total fitness tracking system, including key
metrics, the system itself, and outcomes so far. [Fitness Tracking
Spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/k1pE8e) and [DMAIC Fitness
Presentation](http://bit.ly/jNu2Ae)

**Blue of [hello-the-future.net](http://hello-the-future.net)**: Every
week I sit down with my guitar and make a new song for the internet. In
my presentation, we'll hear just how fast a musician can level up in a
year.

**Daniel Gartenberg**: Proactive Sleep, a mobile self-tracking tool.

## Presentations

### Xaq

Xaq presented CigLog, a home-brewed cigarette-habit-tracking PHP/MySQL
webapp. He talked about the value of social support in trying to create
(keep tracking!) or destroy (stop smoking!) habits.

#### Xaq's Links {#xaqs_links}

[The Science of Self
Control](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Self-Control-Howard-Rachlin/dp/0674013573)
This book is required reading for anyone interested in how habits are
formed and extinguished, and the paradox of self control... why is is
hard to do things that are good for us (ok, me), and so easy to do
things that are bad?

### Bjorn

Bjorn described working with data from UAVs, which led him to wonder how
he could benefit from similar data analysis on his self. He presented an
impressive array of projects: GPS logging, using a web notebook to keep
track of his thoughts, and a DIY pulse/oximeter (which I, Xaq, saw in
prototypical form this past Monday and dang was it cool).

#### Bjorn's Links {#bjorns_links}

[TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com) or
[TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com) "discoursive non-linear web
notebooks" [SIMILE Timeline](http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/) -
Potential visualization tool for GPS data?

Bjorn metioned a few articles:

    Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/3881/)
-   [Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion

-   [Obituary of Reverend Robert Shields---the dark side of
    QS?](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/us/29shields.html)

### Erica

Erica talked about her experience with the Bodybugg, a fitness device
that tracks steps and calories. She explained some principles of weight
loss, showed some photos and graphs of her results, and talked about
some common ideas about weight loss and whether her experience confirmed
or debunked those ideas.

### Elephant Ninja (aka Robert) {#elephant_ninja_aka_robert}

Mr. Ninja told us how the disturbing motivational power of video game
achievement systems inspired him to implement a similar, low-tech system
to help him improve his pull-ups.

### Matthew

Matthew talked about using engineering principles in the realm of self
improvement.

### Blue

Blue told the story of her project to learn guitar the right way - by
playing songs and posting them on YouTube as Hello, the Future! She
played two songs, one from the beginning of the project, and one from
the end, to show her progression.

This video cuts between Blue playing the same song at weeks 1 and 52 of
her project.

### Daniel

Daniel presented his mobile app, ProactiveSleep, which allows the user
to track several habits and see correlations between them. He talked
about lowering the cost of tracking, and the need for (and seeming lack
of) statistcal analysis in self-quantification.

compressed copy...
