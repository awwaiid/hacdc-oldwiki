The HacDC Reading list, featuring the finest hacker tomes. (If you have
ideas on how to organize, categorize, and linkize these, use the
discussion page. I've avoided adding too much detail, so as to minimize
the amount of work that will need to be done to re-arrange the list once
a more useful organization scheme is hatched.)

### Electronics

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{amazon|0596514379|Fashioning Technology: A DIY Intro to Smart Crafting}}
    ```
    by Syuzi Pakhchyan

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{amazon|0945053282|Getting Started in Electronics}}
    ```
    by Forrest Mims

:   A very readable and nearly mathematics free guide to electronics
    components and schematics. There are many small projects that can be
    completed in a single evening of work.

    {{amazon|1878707035|Engineer's Notebook}}
    ```
    by Forrest Mims

:   Continues where `<i>`{=html}Getting Started in
    Electronics`</i>`{=html} ends and has many cookbook solutions to
    common tasks. If you've seen the Radio Shack "Mini notebooks", this
    is a compilation of all of them.

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{amazon|0071452818|Practical Electronics for Inventors}}
    ```
    by Paul Scherz

:   Similar in to Forrest Mims' books, but with more theory and math.
    Lots of analog circuits and discrete logic examples.

### Computers

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{amazon|1593270038|Write Great Code Volume 1: Understanding the machine}}
    ```

:   Excellent introduction to computer architecture. This is a guide to
    understanding how CPUs and memory hierarchies work, how numbers are
    represented, how arrays are laid out, and so on.

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{amazon|1593270658|Write Great Code Volume 2: Thinking low-level, writing high-level}}
    ```

:   Almost better than Volume 1, this one focuses on how to write better
    code by understanding what the CPU, memory and compiler are doing
    underneath all of the syntactic sugar provided by high-level
    languages. Very important information for anyone writing in a high
    level language (like C) for embedded systems (like the AVR).

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{amazon|020161622X|The Pragmatic Programmer}}
    ```

:   Language independent guidelines for writing better code, working
    better with development groups and management, and avoiding common
    problems.
