## Build / Test OpenTDCS v4 {#build_test_opentdcs_v4}

Shawn has received three (3) v4 PCBs from fabrication. The plan is to
build at least one and have a look on the Oscilloscope.

A single prototype was built. The output looked sensical, but the
current limiting functions didn't appear to be calibrated to the
expected values. [Shawn](User:Nocko) only spent a few minutes
with the multimeter / scope.
