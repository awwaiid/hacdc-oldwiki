## The Core Policy Concept : C4K {#the_core_policy_concept_c4k}

Our core policy concept is **Command, Control, Communications,
*Collaboration*, and *Khaos***. While we are very serious about
following our policies, the core concept is a [
tongue-in-cheek](wikipedia:Tongue_in_cheek) reference to the
military concept of [ C4I](wikipedia:C4ISTAR), which stands
for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence. In
following the [ Khaos policy](:Category:Khaos_Policy),
Collaboration and Khaos are better than Computers and Intelligence, so
we swapped those last two appropriately.

-   **[ Command](:Category:Command_Policy)**: What members
    and project stakeholders agree upon, in addition to compliance with
    law and standards of good governance. Our [Articles of
    Incorporation](Articles_of_Incorporation),
    [Bylaws](Bylaws), this [Policy
    Manual](Policy_Manual) as well as relevant
    [Proclamations](Proclamations), the [Resource Use
    Policy](Resource_Use_Policy), and our [Privacy
    Policy](Privacy_Policy) are the basic "command" for good
    corporate governance and compliance as a [
    501(c)(3)](wikipedia:501%28c%29#501.28c.29.283.29) exempt
    non-profit organization. Our meetings are governed by our
    home-brewed [MIBS Simplified Rules of Coordinated Consensus through
    Chaos](MIBS_Simplified_Rules_of_Coordinated_Consensus_through_Chaos),
    an effective alternative to [ Robert's
    Rules](wikipedia:Roberts_Rules).

-   **[ Control](:Category:Control_Policy)**: How things get
    done in the most productive, transparent and honest way possible.
    How are privileges and access assigned and what are the associated
    responsibilities? Who is responsible for certain mission critical
    functions? The members in [Central
    Services](Central_Services) help the organization run
    efficiently. They are primarily responsible for managing things like
    the [Financial Operations
    Policy](Financial_Operations_Policy) which includes
    [Fundraising](Fundraising),
    [Procurement](Procurement),
    [Inventory](Inventory) and [ Financial
    Reporting](Financial_Reports). They also work on [Public
    Relations](Public_Relations).

-   **[ Communications](:Category:Communications_Policy)**:
    We have an obligation to [ communicate clearly and
    effectively](Effective_Communication#Within_The_Group)
    within HacDC as well as a duty to [ communicate effectively with the
    general
    public.](Effective_Communication#With_the_Outside_World)
    This policy outlines the technical structure of our communications
    systems as well as [ guidelines for communicating
    effectively](Effective_Communication) as a whole.

```
-   **[ Collaboration](:Category:Collaboration_Policy)**: We
    are here to collaborate. In one word, it is what we do. In serving
    charitable, educational and scientific purposes, our five point [
    mission statement](Mission_Statement) says that HacDC:

1.  [ Build and maintain spaces suitable for technical and social
    collaboration](Mission_Statement#Build_and_maintain_spaces_suitable_for_technical_and_social_collaboration)
2.  [ Collaborate on all forms of technology, culture and craft in new
    and interesting
    ways](Mission_Statement#Collaborate_on_all_forms_of_technology,_culture_and_craft_in_new_and_interesting_ways)
3.  [ Apply the results of its work to specific cultural, charitable and
    scientific
    causes](Mission_Statement#Apply_the_results_of_its_work_to_specific_cultural,_charitable_and_scientific_causes)
4.  [ Freely share its research and discoveries, using what is learned
    to teach
    others](Mission_Statement#Freely_share_its_research_and_discoveries,_using_what_is_learned_to_teach_others)
    (which is why we follow a very liberal [Licensing
    Policy](Licensing_Policy))
5.  [ Recruit and develop talented members dedicated to these
    purposes](Mission_Statement#Recruit_and_develop_talented_members_dedicated_to_these_purposes)

-   **[ Khaos](:Category:Khaos_Policy)**: Let's not take
    ourselves too seriously. Respect the MIBS and the MIBS will respect
    and nourish you. [Khaos](Khaos) is also the designated
    graffiti wall on our wiki.
