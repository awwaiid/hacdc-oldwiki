Rob. Hi.

By day I'm a mild-mannered USAID contractor. By night I'm a
mild-mannered father of two living in Silver Spring. I'm pretty
mild-mannered generally. My work involves building devices and capacity
to build devices in support of international development projects.

I have been a platonic amateur radio operator (WR2S) since 2006 -- I
know where the PTT button is but I don't find much cause to interact
with it.

I follow North Korea like some people follow Star Trek. The conventions
aren't very good, though. (Did you know that when Kim Jong-Un was being
groomed for the succession, there was a major propaganda campaign in the
DPRK about CNC technology? The idea, never explicitly stated, was that
Jong-Un's youth was actually an advantage, in that he had new ideas that
were going to bring North Korea a technological edge. The result was
some pretty extravagant material about CNC. To wit:
