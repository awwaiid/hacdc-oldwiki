### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

This month with several large catch-up dues payments, we were a net
positive after expenses of \$440. It is difficult to assess the expected
monthly income from looking at the cash flow spreadsheet because of
differing payment cadences, the best way is through looking at the
current membership numbers. We added two new members last month, for a
total of 25 members in good standing. At the current rates that everyone
is paying it works out to an average of \$1340 a month. This is below
our breakeven point (\~1600) so we are slowly losing money though we as
the BOD are looking into methods to extend HacDC's funding support.
