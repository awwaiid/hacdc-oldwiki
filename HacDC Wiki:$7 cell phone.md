**The Story**

In April 2014, on the way home from a business trip to Southeast Asia, I
spent a few days in Shenzhen, China, to visit the [famous electronics
markets of Huaqiang
Bei](http://dangerousprototypes.com/2012/04/19/global-geek-shenzhen-seg-market-mega-post/),
catch [Shenzhen Maker Faire](http://www.shenzhenmakerfaire.com/), and
spend a little time with the attendees of [Hacker Camp
Shenzhen](http://dangerousprototypes.com/hackercampshenzhen/).

Having read [Bunnie Huang's blog
post](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=3107) about a \$12
locally-manufactured phone he bought at Shenzhen's Mingtong Digital
Communications Market (also known as the "Dodgy Cell Phone Market"), I
was interested to check out that market and maybe get one myself. As it
turns out, the invisible hand has pushed Bunnie's phone aside and
replaced it with an even cheaper model.

Mingtong is crazy. Many floors of kiosks selling fake Samsung and Apple
phones, phones shaped like cars or improbably blinged out. I asked a
number of vendors for their cheapest phone, and they all showed me the
same phone -- most all the other vendors carried it too -- a nondescript
candybar phone that looked a bit like a classic Nokia, but with 3M
adhesive backing around the screen (I have to wonder -- real 3M?). The
asking price for these was about 45 RMB or a little more than US\$7. I
bought three. The vendor peeled off the adhesive backing on each and
slapped on a Samsung faceplate, explaining that she was all out of Nokia
faceplates and couldn't offer me a choice.

I left one of the phones at the space for inspection by the curious
and/or for hacking. If people find cool stuff to do with it, I can
donate the other two.
