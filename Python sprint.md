## What's planned

Are you a Python programmer who wants to learn about how Python is
developed and to make the upcoming Python 2.6 release better? Join us
for a half-day sprint!

During the Global Python Sprint Weekend, on May 10-11, participants will
meet over IRC to look at open issues, fix bugs, and get feedback on
patches. HacDC is hosting a face-to-face meeting on Saturday to help you
get up to speed.

Andrew Kuchling, a Python committer, will be present and can help with
questions about bugfixing or general Python queries.

For more information about how bug days work, see [the Python wiki's bug
day page](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBugDay).

## Date/time and location

Saturday May 10 2008, noon - 4PM at the HacDC space.

Address: the HacDC space at 1525 Newton St NW, Washington DC 20010 USA
(Near corner of 16th and Newton NW). See <http://www.hacdc.org> for
maps.

## Want an introductory talk?

If enough people are interested, I can present a short (10-15) minute
introductory talk. It would probably be a greatly shortened and updated
version of [a past python-dev
talk](http://www.amk.ca/talks/python-dev/).

Would an intro be useful to you? If yes, please add your name below so
that I can gauge interest. The talk would probably have to start a
little past noon; let's say 12:30PM.

## What to bring

-   A laptop with wireless and a development environment (compiler,
    Subversion, your favorite editor).
-   A copy of the Python source tree. You could grab [the latest 2.6
    alpha](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/) or [get the
    source using
    Subversion](http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#subversion-svn).
-   An IRC client for your laptop will be helpful.
