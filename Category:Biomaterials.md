# Goals

GrindDC needs to study the biocompatibility of various materials to
support it's work developing [Implants](Implants). There is a
large body of academic literature about the safety of many materials,
however without in house (or professional) testing of the specific
materials to be implanted we cannot account for changes in:

-   manufacturing quality
-   additives to commercially available polymers (plasticizers /
    lubricants)
-   the effect of various methods of sterilization to be performed
    locally

Our initial goal is to generate useful safety and biocompatablilty data
about commercially available or locally-made biomaterials. Continuing
efforts will be focused on using this data to evaluate and refine these
materials for safe human implantation.
