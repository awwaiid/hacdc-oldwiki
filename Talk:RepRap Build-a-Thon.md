:   *Are we committing to doing something like this annually?
    Quarterly?*

Fair disclosure: I live in the Boston area and haven't done any work to
advance the RepRap project, nor do I have any accountability in
supporting this Build-a-Thon. I have no idea how much work was involved
in organizing this, I'm just a guy with an opinion. That said...

I think that from a public relations standpoint, doing fairly frequent
build-a-thons would be a big win. It would convey a message that this
technology is going to stick around, not just be a short-term fad. It
would expose more people to the ideas involved.

It would also help to deploy RepRaps in the way that Adrian Bowyer
envisioned. Once you've made some for yourselves, you can start making
them for local high schools, colleges, and universities. I think it
makes sense to make RepRaps for public libraries as well.

Libraries are about using public resources on a loaner basis, which
sorta fits the RepRap model. People wanting to make stuff would have to
buy the raw plastic from the library or elsewhere, but could then use
the library's computers to download designs or create new designs, and
use the library's RepRap to fabricate the design.
