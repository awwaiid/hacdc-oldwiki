The amateur radio license exams are *not* hard to study for and pass,
and all the resources you need are available online. A good starting
point is [ARRL's Licensing, Education & Training
page](http://www.arrl.org/licensing-education-training).

The questions you will be asked are a random selection from a known and
published [test question pool](http://www.arrl.org/question-pools).

One way to study is to just go through the test pool and memorize all
the correct answers. But if you read through the pools as-is, they've
got all the wrong answers in them too, which I found distracting, and
possibly even misleading. So I wrote a small python script that reads
the test pool files and selects out just the right answers. The code is
awful, but works.
