## Exploration of the Basement Storage Area {#exploration_of_the_basement_storage_area}

We went down to the basement because Mirage mentioned that there was a
binocular microscope stored there. The microscope was found, but it was
missing both the eyepieces and all three objective lenses. The brand
name was recorded.

A small (10x14x20") fish tank was discovered that will be useful for an
initial build of the [Physiological
Saline](PhysiologicalSaline) testing apparatus.

## Pacemaker Project {#pacemaker_project}

To facilitate testing of biomaterials, a simple and small test implant
was proposed. It was proposed that we create a reproduction of an
Elmqvist pacemaker. It is simple, can drive a low-current LED and it
powered/charged inductively.

Having a "go to" easy implant will allow us to start quickly testing
[:Category:Biomaterials](:Category:Biomaterials) with a
realistic payload. Bonus: blinking red LED *heartbeat* is pretty rad
especially once installed in the saline pods.

## tDCS v4 Prototypes {#tdcs_v4_prototypes}

PCBs for the tDCS v4 were sent priority mail on Oct 30th. They should
arrive in time to be built next meeting.

# Homework
