-   **Robotics Course** ([Robot Project](Robot_Project)):
    HacDC is working to develop a set of classes that will function to
    take a beginner with a robotics kit from zero to programming the
    robot's motion and eventual integration with machine learning
    techniques.

-   **Ham Radio** ([HAMRADIO](HAMRADIO)): HacDC maintains a
    heavily used amateur radio station, W3HAC, administered by the HacDC
    Amateur Radio Club (HARC). There are various transceivers at HacDC
    and antennae on the roof of St. Stephen's, as well as a repeater
    station now online. HARC hosts guest speakers, participates in
    contests and holds study sessions and administers FCC amateur radio
    licensing exams.

-   **3D Printing** ([3D Printing](3D_Printing)): HacDC has a
    LulzBot Mini and a significantly modified LulzBot Taz regularly up
    and running; they are run off a 3D print server and instructions for
    logging in and printing remotely are posted by the printers. We also
    have a handful of other 3D printers in various states of repair and
    upgrade including a RockStock Max or two and a RepRap and others.
    These are demonstrated, used, repaired and upgraded during 3D
    Thursdays.

-   **Optical Table Robot** ([PA_OTR](PA_OTR)): OTR includes
    work to build the large-format multi-tool on the basement optical
    table (3D printer, 40-100W laser cutter, pick-n-place, router) as
    well as work to purchase and upgrade a smaller laser cutter tool for
    classroom use. Current (2016) efforts are focused on designing and
    assembling the upgrades to the smaller classroom cutter (40W) which
    will be used for training before moving onto the high-power machine.
    Work overlaps with Microcontroller Mondays and 3D Thursdays.

-   **Spaceblimp** ([HacDC Spaceblimp](HacDC_Spaceblimp)):
    HacDC has launched, tracked (with GPS and radios) and recovered six
    stratospheric balloons, regularly reaching 100,000ft and collecting
    various data including beautiful pictures of our lovely blue planet.
    We expect to participate in the Global Space Balloon Challenge in
    2017 once the jet stream gets back into its Spring position.

-   **CRISPR** ([DC CRISPR Initiative at
    HacDC](DC_CRISPR_Initiative_at_HacDC)): CRISPR-Cas9 is a
    revolutionary new gene-editing technique. Project CRISPR will (2017)
    edit the genome of E.Coli to add some antibiotic resistance using
    the Open Discovery Institute's DIY Bacterial CRISPR Kit. Materials
    are on-hand and event planning for the first event is underway.
    Project CRISPR will explore HacDC's interest in microbiology in
    general.

-   **Electron Microscope** ([PA_SEM](PA_SEM)): Project SEM
    is the ongoing restoration of a scanning electron microscope at
    HacDC.

-   **Expansion** ([PA_EXPANSION](PA_EXPANSION)): Buy and/or
    build tools and equipment, with focus on rapid expansion of HacDC
    capabilities. Expansion categories include without exception,
    manufacturing, electronics, optics, particle physics, semiconductor
    fabrication, and biohacking.

```{=html}

-   **Supplies** ([PA_SUPPLIES](PA_SUPPLIES)): Repair
    equipment. Maintain consumables, office supplies, spare parts, and
    other items routinely needed or sold at HacDC.

-   [Stuff](Stuff): HacDC has lots of stuff. More stuff is
    always coming in. HacDC has a limited amount of space. Some stuff
    has to go out.
