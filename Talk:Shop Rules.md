-   Can these be rolled into [Resource Use
    Policy](Resource_Use_Policy) for clarity's sake?

    -   given these are meant to guide behavior in the shop and not the
        usage of hacdc resources beyond not destroying tools for use in
        projects my opinion would be no. [Do not jsut gvie up bsecuae

    -   good point.. since there is some redundancy (#Tool & Equipment
        Use), maybe once the Shop Rules are completed and approved we
        could tweak the T&EU section to simply point here... ??
