## Summary

Single expenditures are important to the operation of HacDC and its
Events and Projects. However, multiple single-expenditures that are
really outlays for a particular Event or Project, form a defacto ad-hoc
budget. These de-facto ad-hoc budgets can become quite large and
Membership only can only know how large, after the fact. Ad-hoc defacto
budgets can easily consume most of the HacDC funds and push-back other
Events or Projects that require real budgets. Real budgets are burdened
by approval whereas ad-hoc defacto budgets do not require approval, even
though they can theoretically spend as much funds as a real budget.

## Potential Solutions {#potential_solutions}

-   Lower the limit of single expenditures to \$100 and record the
    expenditures in the weekly finance report and require pre-approval
    for reimbursements over \$100
    -   Pros:
        -   HacDC members are able to execute single expenditures
        -   Any quickly organized Event/Project that attempts to use
            multiple single-expenditures as a de facto ad-hoc budget
            would be limited from doing so.
        -   HacDC members would be informed at least once a week as to
            what single expenditures have been executed
        -   Depletion of HacDC funds by de facto ad-hoc budgets would be
            limited
        -   Single Expenditures would be limited in purpose for
            providing one-shot low cost resources (food, soda, etc) for
            Events and Projects
    -   Cons:
        -   Quickly organized events would require the organizers to get
            approval from HacDC membership for funding beyond single
            expenditures
        -   Quickly organized space building/storage infrastructure
            improvements would require the organizers to get approval
            from HacDC membership for funding beyond single expenditures
        -   Quickly organized Projects over \$100 in total costs would
            require the organizer to get approval from HacDC membership
            for funding beyond single expenditures
        -   Quickly organized projects that may require reimbursements
            to be implemented would require the organizers to get
            approval from HacDC membership.

## PROPOSAL

The following Administrative Policy is submitted for discussion:

-   Single Expenditures
    -   Single expenditures under \$100 do not require approval
    -   Single expenditures that are \$100 or over, require approval by
        [quorum](quorum) of the voting membership.
    -   All single expenditures must be recorded by the Minster of
        Finance in the weekly Finance Report as a line item that shows
        the day, amount, and purpose of the expenditure.
-   Reimbursements
    -   Reimbursements over \$100 require pre-approval by quorum of the
        voting membership.
