## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project EXPANSION - Mirage {#project_expansion___mirage}

### Project HAMRADIO - Jeff {#project_hamradio___jeff}

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM) - Julia {#project_electron_microscope_sem___julia}

Stalled for last month, we have new seals except for the one we know is

replace it

### Project Optical Table Robot (OTR) -Julia {#project_optical_table_robot_otr__julia}

### Project CRISPR -Enrique {#project_crispr__enrique}

No update; too busy with Spaceblimp lately.

### Project SpaceBlimp -Enrique {#project_spaceblimp__enrique}

Enrique: Launch date (for test-launch) looks like 2018/03/24

Nancy: We will be working with Houston Elementary School, they are
excited to participate. We are in conversation about how we are going to
manage the students. Most likely it will be us going to them. My idea is
that the students visit all of the different organizations that are
involved in the Space Blimp project. We also have a group of Girl Scouts
that will be getting involved. We are working on those last details.

### Project Media Outreach - Matt {#project_media_outreach___matt}

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff) {#director_reports_governance_related_stuff}

### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

I've been making a bunch of new computers for the space. New lasercutter
driver, new Classroom TV, new basement TV.

Also got access to the phone system recently. I've setup a voip phone in
the basement, which can be rung from the main menu.

I've created a roadmap for work to be done on the lasercutter.

I got somebody to come pick up some of our trash, with the potential to
come pick up more trash in the future.

I'm trying to create a wiki for reverse engineering in general. I think
I've purchased a domain, ikiw.io, and will provision a server for it
eventually.

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

I have not fully transferred all account credentials since this past
weekend.

I am currently looking over the Google Drive spreadsheets to get a
better assessment of our financial situation. I will also be talking to
the past treasurer Enrique as soon as possible to make sure that I can
change the two-factor authentication system to work with my setup.

We have not collected dues from several members for the past three
months, we will send an email to the members affected and charge \$90
instead of \$60 to close the gap from the months lost (for 6 months,
then back to \$60).

We will be sending out an email in the future to tell old subscribers to
update their subscription to the new PayPal system that does
auto-renewals (as opposed to requiring me to manually request every
month).

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}
