# Plans

Arc and Redbeard are planning on producing a tutorial for an AVR based
reflow oven. The goal of the project is to be an updated version of the
sparkfun reflow oven with a better graphical display and improved user
input system.

# Goals

-   Use AVR
-   Provide visualization of temperature graph
-   Produce board kit
-   Be cost equivalent (or cheaper) than sparkfun
-   Be programmable via keypad or serial port
-   Provide real time output via serial
-   All through hole (otherwise you're in chicken vs egg mode)

# Parts List {#parts_list}

-   SPST Relay (at least 30 amps)
-   AVR (At least ATMega168, possibly ATMega328
-   Thermocouple
-   LCD Display
-   Keypad
-   Fuse Holder?
-   Thermocouple Amplifier

# Upgrades

-   Line inside of oven with Reflect-a-gold - [Manufacturer's

    (Will improve cooling ramp down times)
