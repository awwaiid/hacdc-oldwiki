Do we want to include local anime conventions like [Anime
USA](http://www.animeusa.org/), [Otakon](http://www.otakon.com/), and
[Katsucon](http://www.katsucon.com/)? Does it make sense for HacDC to
have a presence at these events? Do we want to look at additional genres
of local events, like hamfests? - [Katie](User:Katie) 03:16,
