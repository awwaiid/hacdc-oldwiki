## Recognition

## New Members {#new_members}

## Old Business {#old_business}

-   Matt Z encouraged to submit a proposal re: his MOU two weeks in
    advance of next meeting.

## New Business {#new_business}

-   Enrique - Should we invest in off-site storage unit, move the
    majority of the contents of the basement shelves to this cold
    storage, remove the basement shelves, install bright lighting,
    seating and work surfaces in the rear room?

## [Project Awesome](:Category:Project_Awesome) Reports {#project_awesome_reports}

### Project SUPPLIES - Mirage {#project_supplies___mirage}

Nothing to report, this month.

### Project EXPANSION - Mirage {#project_expansion___mirage}

Nothing to report, this month.

### Project HAMRADIO - Jeff {#project_hamradio___jeff}

### Project Electron Microscope (SEM) - Enrique {#project_electron_microscope_sem___enrique}

-   Nothing important. Skip unless someone wants to read it: Electronics
    need to be checked for debris that may have fallen into it and could
    short stuff out. In retrospect we shouldn't leave a 15kV power
    supply uncovered so random shit can fall into it. After that, power
    on, see what happens to pressure. We need space to work on this, so
    it should be a separate SEM workday (date TBD).
-   An **untested** cable for connecting the vacuum gauge to a computer
    serial port (RS-232 / DB-9) has been built.

### Project Optical Table Robot (OTR) -Julia {#project_optical_table_robot_otr__julia}

### Project CRISPR -Enrique {#project_crispr__enrique}

Preparing a Saturday workshop. The check of the as-received bacteria and
antibiotic was successful: bacteria grow, but not on the antibiotic. The
time constraints are still problematic; 4-hour and 12-16 hour steps
don't lend themselves well to an after-hours hobby. Sophia took the
samples home last time to get the timing right. Also found a short
Prezi.com presentation of someone else obviously doing the same
experiment and having the same issues we had (control also grows),
weirdly reassuring.

### Project SpaceBlimp -Enrique {#project_spaceblimp__enrique}

As of this writing, we haven't located the Spaceblimp components:
balloon, filling hardware, rigging, payload enclosure, radios, GPS...
everything. There seems to be an entire bin misplaced or missing and if
we don't find it soon this is not happening. A bunch of us will go down
to NC/SC to watch the eclipse regardless though.

### Project Media Outreach - Matt {#project_media_outreach___matt}

### Project IT Infrastructure - Tom {#project_it_infrastructure___tom}

I don't know the status of this budget and don't have any immediate
purchase plans.

## Member Reports {#member_reports}

-   Enrique - In contact with TOOOL and looking at dates for a
    lockpicking class in late August or maybe September.
-   Enrique - If someone wants to arrange another Metasploit workshop
    let me know and I'll give you Hamza's email address.

## Director Reports (Governance related stuff) {#director_reports_governance_related_stuff}

### President's Report {#presidents_report}

### Vice President's Report {#vice_presidents_report}

The church has had two building-wide outages in the past month, as well
as a currently ongoing outage local to one tenant's connection.

I will re-iterate that we are in need of a reorganization of the server
closet, clarification of the duties of HacDC's volunteer staff, and
better documentation of the existing physical infrastructure.

### Treasurer's Report {#treasurers_report}

-   We now have a DC business license, which we were lacking before.
    Still waiting to hear about our solicitation license which I also
    applied for. It might be in the mail. This is so we can legally get
    more than \$1500 in donations or grants per year, which we should
    aim for.

Next: find & seek grants! With all our paperwork in order I think we
should contact the DC government (mayor?) directly and ask if they have
a mechanism to help us financially.

-   I applied for a hardware donation from SparkFun and were awarded
    \$150. (yay!) We have to build a wishlist and send it to them.
    Please make suggestions and r I'll pick stuff out myself.

-   I asked Lockheed Martin for \$1900 to support an FPGA programming
    workshop. (Surprise, Julia!) We'll see what they say. I also got
    HacDC on their list of volunteer opportunities listing
    Microcontroller and FPGA programing.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Northrop Grumman and Booz Allan's charity programs are invite-only
    but I contacted them to find out more and invite volunteers to come
    help out.

### Secretary's Report {#secretarys_report}

(Ben Resigned - Enrique)

### Director-at-Large Reports {#director_at_large_reports}

#### Kevin

-   We've been invited to the 2nd Community Networking Meeting hosted by
    Thrive DC. This will be in October. I attended the first one a few
    months ago, but will be out of the country for the second one. Julia
    has RSVP'd to represent us at the second meeting.
-   The DC chapter of the ACM has a new chair who's interested in
    reaching out to other tech communities. So, I've reached out to her,
    and she's hoping to come by for one of the open houses and see what
    we might plan together.
