## Approaches

Discussion on varying approaches and implementations

### Approach to project implementation {#approach_to_project_implementation}

1.  Collaborative - work as a group on the same project (something new,
    something done before)
2.  Independent - everyone work independently on their projects

### Approach to tech implementation {#approach_to_tech_implementation}

1.  Use an SEM
    1.  Option 1 - get enough of the SEM fixed to operate manually
    2.  Option 2 - get the full SEM working
    3.  Option 3 - get the obviously broken part fabricated and replace
        it (part on back with dent in back of the SEM)
    4.  Option 4 - do Project Awesome fundraising project
    5.  Option 5 - the sputtering system issue needs to be resolved as
        part of the microfab process
    6.  Option 6 - a cleaning chamber issue needs to be resolved as part
        of the microfab process
    7.  Option 7 - working with hydrogen chloride indoors to etch glass
        issue needs to be resolved as part of the microfab process
    8.  Option 8 - decide on wet etching vs. dry etching
    9.  Option 9 - "rent" Ethan's personal-use SEM (assuming its
        working)
2.  Use The-Next-Best-Thing
    1.  Option 1 - Sonic 8K - can -- stick PCB to layers of resin
        directly to fabricate things at 28 microns
    2.  Option 2 - electro chemical plating
    3.  Option 3 - UV lithography
    4.  Option 4 - electron beam lithography
    5.  Option 5 - "do what's been done before" (Ethan)
    6.  Option 6 - "create a diode"...the simplest component we can
        start fabricating (Tristan)
    7.  Option 7 - "create a DIY sputtering" system and publish results
        to community (Ethan)

##### More on Outsource approach: {#more_on_outsource_approach}

tech is moving so fast that the Fab Shops of yesterday doing "1000
nanoML" are obsolete for commercial business/work doing "50 nanoML" and
so then outsource to smaller clients that maybe "1000 nanoML" is all
they need

Outsource the Fab Work (they have open time/space to run "shuttles" -
groups sponsor); They split the cost among a bunch of people. Can get
ICs manufactured for \$650-\$1000. They get put in "shuttles" which
people apply for and get decided upon by "lottery." See Skywater link.
