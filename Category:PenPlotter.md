HP Draft Pro Plus

# Current Machine Status {#current_machine_status}

Operational, with dedicated laptop. Run 'sudo plot.sh
`<filename>`{=html}' to convert and transfer postscript vector files.

Electronics have shown a bit of odd behaviour recently, taking several
minutes to power on.

Currently offsite, as property of Dan Barlow given to Mirage335 (talk).
Please feel free to request plots of vector PS files. If interest in the
plotter picks up, the machine itself is likely to return as well.

# Operation

Really quite simple.

1.  Ready paper feed. Lift the lever as shown in the diagrams stickered
    to the machine.
2.  Insert paper. Make sure to flatten, and align the right-hand edge
    with the arrow and line on the movable roller clamp.
3.  Clamp. Press the lever down, while ensuring the paper remains flat.
    Plotter should automatically shuffle the paper to ensure a good fit.
4.  Call plot.sh script on the desired postscript file.

# Stationery

Roughly A2 sized paper is provided in a bucket on the floor. Much larger
paper can be handled, of course.

# Support

See mirage335 at HacDC's IRC channel. If he is around and not to busy,
Dan Barlow is the plotter's owner, and an expert in all trades.

# Please Avoid {#please_avoid}

Plotter is Dan Barlow's property, not HacDC. He will be quite
disappointed if it is damaged. Additionally, it has been a great public
demo for HacDC on many occasions. Please be gentle.

In particular, be delicate with the mechanics. Nothing should ever need
to be forced.

If in doubt, consult the support options mentioned above. Better to ask
questions than to cause damage.

# Cavets

-   Coordinates must always use landscape orientation, even in paper is
    loaded in a portrait direction. Check HPGL files for landscape
    orientation.

# Future Improvements {#future_improvements}

-   Single-mode 405nm 1W UV [BDR-209 laser
    diode](https://sites.google.com/site/dtrlpf/home/diodes/bdr-209-405nm-16x-diodes)
    scorching/engraging/cutting laser. Will offer finer linewidths than
    traditional pens, infinite 'ink', and precision cutting
    capabilities.
