-   Electronic components ; don't we have plenty? Missing something?
-   Microcontrollers, programmers?
-   Raspberry Pis for teaching events?
-   New 100 MHz oscilloscope; this might be instead of everything else
    here (\$\$).
-   Thermocouples / readouts
-   PLA / ABS Spools
-   Safety goggles, first aid kits
-   Impact driver (05W4992) ; may not be a good choice, limited
    selection here.
-   Face glasses that let you see but block much of the light made when
    the middle part of the smallest possible piece of smoke stops
    shaking side to side and instead the outer parts start shaking in
    and out or the whole piece starts turning quickly.
