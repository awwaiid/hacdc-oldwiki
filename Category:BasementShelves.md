# Hazards

-   Some of the nearby ceiling wiring may be live. Don't touch.
-   Screws and splinters.

# FIRE SAFETY

Anything that can set the shelves or their contents on fire is not
allowed.

-   **DO NOT** leave any **lights** or other **hot appliances** turned
    on in the basement, and especially not in the back room.
-   Flammable items (hydrocarbons, propane canisters, reactive
    chemicals, etc) are not to be placed on wood shelves, nor exposed to
    floor moisture.
-   Items (if any) on top shelf must be low-profile and 3' from pipes,
    chandelier, and other ceiling obstructions.
-   Equipment left permanently online in the basement must be properly
    enclosed for fire safety (eg. in case of CPU heatsink failure). Bare
    motherboards are specifically not allowed.

# Guidlines

Please consider the following to ease HacDC cleanup efforts:

-   Larger, **bulky** items should be stored closer toward the door, and
    **accessible from the side** if possible.
-   If there are **two or more of something**, all that something should
    be in the **same place**, on the same shelf.
-   Keep good-condition items toward the left-side of the shelves,
    poor-condition items toward the right-side. This is to allow easy
    disposal of poor-condition items as replacements arrive. Example:
    broken laptops would be placed toward the right side.
-   Leaving space between categories of items for expansion and easy
    re-sorting is strongly preferred.
-   Stacking items to fill the entire 16" shelf height is strongly
    preferred.
-   Water sensitive materials (ie. cardboard) not recommended at floor
    level.
-   Push-pins are best for re/movable labels. Especially avoid
    unnecessarily weakening wood with screws or nails.
