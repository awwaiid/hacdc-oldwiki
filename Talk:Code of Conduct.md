## Grammatical correction

-   Delete of after Misuse under Safety Rules (Bobby)
    -   Good catch. Done. Thanks.

## A deletion or a culture shift

`* Guests are not allowed to use tools and equipment except as part of a scheduled workshop. `

Given the nature of our "open house" nights, which I would not consider
to be a "scheduled workshop" this line will probably need to go or we
will need to start re-educating some of the regulars...

## preliminary comments

General comment: It is important to CLEARLY distinguish between rules
and requests. They are definitely not the same. Do: Ask questions -
Don't - Interrupt presentations, workshops, or mentoring sessions -
contradictory! conduct that consists of loud or boisterous physical
behavior or talking. This includes all forms of harassment - no, it
doesn't. It is possible to harass someone quietly & nonboisterously. I
suggest splitting this: excessively loud talking or boisterous behavior
harassment of any kind (but constitutionally-protected free speech by
itself cannot constitute harassment) directing a specific threat of
physical harm against an individual, group of individuals, or property -
suggested rewording: making a specific threat to cause harm to an
individual, group, or property I recommend adding: leave the space open
without a member present Safety Rules - they should be rules, not
requests as currently written Cleaning up and putting away equipment
belongs elsewhere; it is not a safety issue (unlike shutting off or
unplugging equipment is). Possible addition: No horseplay in the space -
there is too much dangerous or fragile stuff here Guests - recommended
tool use rules: Guests may use nonhazardous tools in a proper manner.
Guests may use hazardous tools they are familiar with in a proper manner
if monitored by a member. Guests may be taught to use an unfamiliar tool
by a member familiar with that tool. Anyone who misuses a tool may be
barred from using HacDC tools. (Note that this allows HacDC to bar
someone who misuses their own tools from using HacDC tools, which seems
like a good idea.) Members are responsible for their guests and their
actions - suggested rewording: Members are responsible for monitoring
guests. Minors - I strongly oppose this entire section. HacDC should not
discriminate.

I will undoubtedly come up with much more.

## Mirage: comments

Most importantly, lack of barriers to entry, such as strict rules about
equipment usage, borrowing, or supplies consumption, has been a huge
success at HacDC, to be continued. We have not had a problem with
accidents, nor substantial damage from supplies overconsumption, nor
theft. Permanent injuries have not happened, tools have not been damaged
in operation, and minimal supplies budgets have not remotely been
drained. This is an important part of HacDC's unique character to be
continued.

All major problems at HacDC have been the result of total absence of
common sense or deliberate abuse. Most probably deliberate abuse. These
incidents are in an entirely separate category from on-mission
activities, while often using the same resources.

We need to require disruptive members, and the disruptive guests they
allow, to reach a credible "cease and desist" agreement, or be
immediately barred from the space until they do. We need to do this
without interfering with, or discouraging, our vast majority of
contributing volunteers. Immediate action is not a permanent banhammer,
but it may be followed with such.

Our bylaw amendment, empowering the board to bar access for "substantial
cause", is also intended to apply to members who bring trouble, as well
as their own behaviour. Members bringing in live ammunition, would be
responsible for doing so safely, as opposed to displaying it in an
obviously threatening manner. Likewise, members are responsible for the
guests they bring in, and can be barred for continuing to allow
disruptive guests.

Explicit rules alone are not the answer. Too many situations will
involve substantial cause that involve resources being used as expected,
to a degree that is not appropriate. Rearranging some things in the
space is normal. Occasionally using a TV set is normal. Sitting in a
chair is normal. Even some personal use may be normal, below the
threshold of what the IRS would consider substantial. Scattering the
components of a tool, burning days of daytime TV on a maintenance
intensive display, or sleeping overnight in a chair, is not appropriate.

What we need to do, is provide guidance - in addition to rules - to
fairly explain to newcomers, members, and guests - the wonderful things
they are allowed to do, as well as the category of things they are
expected not to do. Realistically, most would never think of doing the
things in the latter category to begin with.

To that end, a Wiki document was written a while back as guidance
summarizing some norms as well as the mechanics of how things could
work. <https://wiki.hacdc.org/index.php/ResponsibilitiesOfMembership>

To provide further guidance of what is in the category of on-mission, as
opposed to inappropriate, use of HacDC resources, another wiki document
has been put up. It may be the first attempt to formally write down the
culture of how HacDC operates, both to encourage newcomers to quickly
become comfortable with the freedom we offer, as well as to provide a
sense of fairness for policy makers.

## Bobby's version of CoC

​I still think the proposed Code of Conduct, even after the tool use
policy was changed, would make undesirable changes to the open way HacDC
operates, so I have created an alternative proposal. The design
philosophy is that it should largely just codify the way HacDC currently
runs, but I do feel increased attention to safety is warranted. This is
quite preliminary; I'm sure I'm forgetting things I'd want to include.

Proposed alternative code of conduct:

The Code of Conduct is intended to maximize HacDC's benefit (to both its
members and the community) and minimize risk and restrictions.

### General

-   Except for distinguishing between members and nonmembers, HacDC
    shall treat all people as individuals, not members of any group, and
    shall judge them by objective rather than subjective measures. HacDC
    may temporarily or in extreme cases permanently revoke the
    membership of or bar anyone who violates the rules (but not just
    guidelines).

### Membership Rules

-   Anyone who wishes to may become a member.
-   Full members get a key and can use the space at any time.
-   Members get priority for use of tools and equipment.
-   Members may hold events at the space but approval by HacDC is
    required if there is any charge to attend.
-   Members are responsible for monitoring guests in the space.

### Behavior Rules

-   Everyone must tolerate the presence of others and not harass anyone
    or interfere with their use of the space.
-   Everyone can use the space at any time if they are a member or it is
    open but must avoid causing disruption (i.e., noise) during an
    event.
-   Except for caffeine, recreational drugs and pets are prohibited
    unless specifically approved in advance.

### Behavior Guidelines

-   Everyone is encouraged to assist each other and to request
    assistance.
-   Everyone should try to do potentially disruptive activities when
    least likely to be disruptive.
-   Everyone should try to avoid arguments by expressing themselves
    calmly and limiting political or otherwise divisive comments.
-   Everyone is urged to document their work if it is likely to be
    useful to others.

### Safety Rules

-   HacDC shall make sure recommended safety equipment is available &
    functional.
-   Everyone must report any safety hazards they notice (including
    notifying HacDC of an unsafe situation or cautioning someone if they
    are doing something in an unnecessarily risky way).
-   Everyone must caution those present before engaging in an activity
    (i.e., using the lathe) that poses a risk to those nearby.
-   No horseplay.
-   Noone shall engage in any potentially hazardous activity while
    impaired.
-   Noone is allowed in the space while they have a contagious illness.
-   Members shall point out exits & fire extinguishers to guests.

### Safety Guidelines

-   Everyone should pay attention to what is going on around them.

### Tools & Equipment Rules

-   HacDC may require that a particular item can only be used by those
    trained to use it or under the supervision of someone who knows how
    to use it, or require that a person state on camera that they are
    aware of and accept the risks of using it.
-   If HacDC has more than one of an item, HacDC may designate one of
    that item as being for member use only.
-   Some items may be on loan to HacDC; their use may be limited by
    their owner.
-   All restrictions must be clearly posted.
-   All items must be used responsibly. That includes:
-   Everyone must read the instructions or get instruction from someone
    familiar with the item before trying to use an unfamiliar item.
-   Do not try to use an item for an unsuitable purpose.
-   Problems or needed maintenance must be reported.
-   Items may not be left in the wrong place (i.e., a clamp in the
    precision screwdrivers bin).

### Tools & Equipment Guidelines

-   Everyone is urged to put items in the correct location when finished
    with them and clean up debris.

### Guests Rules

-   Guests may only be in the space when a full member is present.
-   Except for specific items designated as members only, guests may use
    tools & equipment with appropriate (as defined by HacDC) supervision
    when no member needs to use that item.

### Revised Safety section rules

-   Everyone must try to minimize risks, to others and to the
    surroundings, in general and from tools & equipment, including:
-   Everyone must understand how to deal with an emergency (recommended
    even if you aren't doing anything hazardous), consider what risks
    exist, and take reasonable precautions before any activity that
    poses a meaningful hazard.
-   Everyone must caution those present before engaging in an activity
    (i.e., using the lathe) that poses a significant risk to those
    nearby.
-   No horseplay.
-   Noone shall engage in any risky activity while impaired.
-   Do not take risky shortcuts.
-   Everyone must report any safety hazards they notice (including
    notifying HacDC of an apparently unsafe condition or cautioning
    someone if they are doing something in an unnecessarily risky way).
-   Anything posing a significant nonobvious hazard must have clear
    notice of the hazard posted.
-   HacDC shall make sure recommended safety equipment is available &
    functional.
-   Members must point out exits & fire extinguishers to guests.
-   Noone is allowed in the space while they have a contagious illness.

### Safety Guidelines

-   Anything abnormal (strange noise, unusual smell, peculiar motion,
    etc.) should be investigated - it may be telling you something
    important (& may give you a good idea!).
-   Everyone is urged to pay attention to what is going on around them.
