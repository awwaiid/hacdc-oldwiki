## Meetup Summaries

Monday's Open Hac

-   Some secondary meetups are beginning to pull the audience to other
    days.

Sunday Games Wednesday LLMs Friday Command Line

Help scheduling the WBL collaboration: screen printing (Fridays)

-   non-members Justin and Jeff had been leading the charge

InfoSec reading group: thursday online

-   Sven may help organize this, there had been no plan

Sven is raising the issue that though many of these are after 5pm, some
are occurring during the business day. Gabe says sprinkling in a couple
during the day helps us balance the schedule. Friday business hours did
seem to be popular.

Laser engraver in the basement has been seeing some use by the
Gentrified Wood group; they are able to access our shop to use this as
needed. Had been missing one night, and they had taken it in for
repairs. Is up and running now and our group is able to make any designs
needed. Seeking a 2d path tracer -\> Gcode program!
