# Budget

## Membership Dues

The general proposal agreed to on Tuesday, May 6 was to charge
\$50/month for dues, strongly encouraging members to donate via PayPal
for privacy reasons.

This amount will be re-evaluated as expenses become more well known.

As of COB on the date of this report, we have 22 dues paying members
establishing a base budget of \$1,100 to cover Rent, Insurance and
Internet for the space.

## Budget Principles Proposal

These were unofficially adopted as the Budget Principles at the planning
meeting on May 13:

-   Our Monthly Expenses (Rent, Insurance, Internet, Basic Supplies)
    shall remain under a fixed amount per month to be fully fundable by
    member dues.
-   Membership dues alone must be able to conver the space's minimal
    expenses
-   Anything raised beyond expenses, be it through a "soda fund", the
    sale of recycled equipment, etc (and not restricted to a cause)
    should go towards group-wide goals approved at a meeting

## Budget Proposals

### HiDeUS (High Density Unit of Shelving) - \$500

I authorized a budget of \$400 for the initial construction. I propose a
budget of \$500.00 for finishing off the shelf, however, we need to
raise May Dues to pay for May Rent first.

### Compliance Paperwork - \$1,003.00 {#compliance_paperwork___1003.00}
