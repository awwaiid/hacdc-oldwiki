### Minister of Finance

\- Would like to start using the [cash
register](cash_register) for soda and component sales, so
people are trained to use it when we go to cons.

\- ToorCon is coming up at the end of September, and HacDC would be a
good place for a [Hackersmart](Hackersmart).

\- Peter asked if we should assess the cons for the next year, and try
to schedule for the next year.

\- Nick mentioned the CCC in Germany in December, and other cons

\- Ben noted the wiki has [a list for cons
upcoming](Conferences)

plan ahead.

Otakon (Baltimore), Freaknic (Nashville)

## Member Reports

### Ben Stanfield

Talked with a woman from Safari Online Book program. \$347 per year per
person to join Safari Online Books. Unlikely to go for this. Ben did ask
about discounts for nonprofits, but they have nothing of the kind. This
is also not their complete plan, only their "Essential Tech", which
means no videos, rough cuts, or extras.

Cassia points out that you can sign up with Montgomery County Library
(even if you don't live in Maryland) and get access to Safari Online for
free.

### Pete

Peter wants to discuss the physical space uses and if we're [planning
ahead for getting a larger space](finding_more_space)?

Nick reported that there are things ongoing. Nick is looking for more
space nearby. He'd like to encourage everyone to look for alternative
spaces. Requirements for spaces are in the district, near public
transit.

Derek had some speculation about having a space in Maryland so there's
an option closer to people there, but no immediate action is planned.
Someone suggested carpooling.

## Old Business

-   There was no old business to discuss.

## New Business

-   There was no new business to discuss.
