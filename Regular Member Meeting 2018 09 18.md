### President's Report

### Vice President's Report

### Treasurer's Report

As with many months in the past, we are continuing to collect past dues,
still a handful of individuals from Paypal and a few individual
retroactive dues paid by check. This month we ended again with a large
net positive (+\$1940) owing to these retroactive dues payments, however
this is not expected to continue. With 24 members (and maybe a new one
soon) we are at slightly above breakeven when paying rent+insurance when
assuming regular dues payments. When we receive non-cash donations, we
should attempt to get a rough valuation so that I can send a receipt for
tax deduction purposes. CFC info: our information has been submitted and
we are waiting on hearing back about the event assignment where we can
promote HacDC.

#### Kevin

-   The **wiki** - It's a bit of a mess full of a ridiculous number of
    spam accounts, and spam. But, it's now been upgraded to a new
    version (1.20 to 1.27), with a new PHP engine (5.4 to 7.0) and is a
    bit more locked down.
