## Changed "property" to "junk"

One of the primary purposes of a hacker space is to hold nifty stuff
that the members can't store at their residences or simply wish to make
available to other members. I see no reason why cool stuff that "remains
without purpose or plan" should be purged after a month simply because
nobody's claimed it yet.

Perhaps another way of expressing this idea is that some stuff is so
potentially useful that, by default, it "has purpose" unless someone
complains that it's wasting space. There definitely is a class of stuff
that should go unless someone wants it, but I don't think all "property"
should be so condemned without due cause.
