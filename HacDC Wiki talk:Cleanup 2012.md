This is a talk page! It's where talking happens!

Create a new section by clicking the "+" tab above. Think of sections
like forum threads. Make a new one for each topic or idea.

**Update**: It's been decided to put discussions on the new [wiki
mailing](https://groups.google.com/a/hacdc.org/group/wiki/topics) list
instead! So, er, I guess this could still be useful sometime, but just
default to the mailing list instead.

## Example section {#example_section}

I'm talking about a particular topic here! Look at me go! Remember to
sign your posts by ending them with four tildes: "\~\~\~\~"

## Dealing with old pages {#dealing_with_old_pages}

So from what I understand, we're going to go around labeling pages that
are outdated with category tags ([category
example](:Category:Proposed_Projects)), with one category for
pages that should be updated and another category for pages that should
be removed?

And then we'll update the former and blank the latter?

## Getting user IP addresses {#getting_user_ip_addresses}

Another idea: do we have the
[CheckUser](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CheckUser)
extension installed?

Because there's like a dozen users being registered [every
day](Special:Log/newusers) here, obviously for some kind of
spamming purpose, all of which follow the same pattern:
FirstnameLastname\[three digits\]. And the CheckUser extension allows us
to give administrators the ability to see the IP addresses used by
registered users. I thought it'd help investigating this phenomenon.

As a more longterm project, maybe we could reject any registration of a
username fitting that pattern (two camelcase words followed by three
digits (m/(\[A-Z\]\[a-z\]){2}\\d{3}/)). For legit users, we can just
tell them that because of spam problems they'll have to choose another
name.

## Member Meeting notes linking {#member_meeting_notes_linking}

More of a note to myself; I'll bring it up on the mailing list later:

It'd be really useful to link the member meeting
[agendas](:Category:Meeting_Agendas)/[minutes](:Category:Meeting_Minutes)
pages together so you can click to the next or previous one right from
their article. I've previously been annoyed by how hard it is at the
moment. It'd work somewhat like the templates Wikipedia often has at the
bottom of articles that have a place in a series (example
[here](wikipedia:Emperor_Meiji#External_links)). We should be
able to do it by defining a template, then making a simple edit to each
article.
